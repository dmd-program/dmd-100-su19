## Writing prompt

In this chapter, Grudin describes arguments over imbuing corporate free market endeavors with moral imperatives, one of which is truthfulness. He also draws correlations between communication of knowledge within a company and its health. He examines Google as a case study in corporate knowledge investment and makes the case for the Chief Knowledge Officer.

How would you try to convince the CEO to take the idea seriously?
