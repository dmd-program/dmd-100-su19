It introduces concepts, skills, language, and principles of practice related to art and design, communications, and information sciences — three discreet disciplines in which students can pursue further study while developing their learning pathways. With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, and instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design. The concept of \"design\" for DMD students is a frame through which complex issues can be discovered and defined and solutions can be best developed and delivered.\nCourse Structure\nDMD 100 is comprised of five lessons that introduce design topics, approaches, and considerations. Each lesson will span one to four weeks depending on the semester. Students will read assigned chapters and course pages, review supplemental media including podcasts and videos, and complete design exercises employing the double-diamond method, culminating in a lesson project and critique. Students are expected to practice the design process throughout the course, and therefore will be assigned several activities a week to provide opportunity for practice and iteration.\nDigital course technology\nA course is not software or a website, but rather the delivery of pedagogy for particular subject matter over a set period of time. Without getting too far into learning theory, you can think of pedagogy as the todo list that an instructor gives students in order to meaningfully engage with and learn course content.\nDelivering pedagogy online has its own set of challenges. We'll be using  a mix of online software to meet the needs of this online course. Canvas is a Learning Management System (LMS) that stores the assignment calendar, grades, and provides an easy way to send messages to everyone in the course. We host the core course text and image-based content in ELMS Learning Network, which is similar to an LMS, but with some custom in-house built tools. One such tool is the Studio, which allows students to more easily share project progress with each other. You will be guided to perform actions through a combination of the Canvas calendar, emails, and explicit assignment instructions. Contact your course instructor via Penn State E-Mail if you are ever confused. It is your responsibility as a student to know when assignments are due.\nTechnical and material requirements\nHardware\n\nComputer: This fully online course will require access to a computer that meets the minimum requirements set by World Campus.\nInternet: You will need broadband Internet to view videos and other media content.\nCamera or cellphone camera: You will be asked to document various aspects of your work\nPrinter/scanner: A printer will be helpful for printing out paper templates. A scanner is optional, but would be helpful.\n\nSoftware\n\nWeb browser: You will need to have the latest version of either Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.\nAccounts: In addition to general University account access, you will be required to create an account with InvisionApp.com\nSoftware installs: You will need to download and install an open-source desktop application called Twine from Twinery.org. It is possible to use a web version of this software if you cannot or wish not to install it on your computer.\n\nMaterials\n\nJournal \nAny journal is fine. I recommend the Moleskine Cahier Journal, Large, Squared, Kraft Brown, Soft Cover (5 x 8.25) Amazon purchase link\n\n\nPens, pencils, markers\nAny that you already own are fine, you do not need to purchase special ones for this course. However, the following recommendations are professional grade if you are so inclined to invest in quality drawing tools.\nPencil: Palomino Blackwing 602\nPen: Copic Multiliner Marker 0.5 - Black\nMarker: Copic N2 \n\n\n\n\nScissors\nPost-it Notes\nPoster board (or large open wall space) for the post-its\n\nBook\nWe will be reading Design and Truth by Robert Grudin.

Admittedly, this means that deciding how and what to teach a designer in a multi-domain program becomes a rather daunting task. On July 01, 2012, Penn State University suspended a program called Science, Technology, and Society (STS)—an event embroiled in controversy—just as Harvard initiated their own STS program. [1] Content of Penn State STS courses included historical contexts for technological, scientific, and social progress through history. These topics are relevant to design because STS subject-matter is a deep-dive into the visible and invisible forces that shape design decisions, and consequently, the impacts of those design decisions on society. The Digital Multimedia Design program intends to bring some of that important context into the curriculum, though it is not intended to (and simply could not hope to) replace supplemental studies into the STS field.\nAs you move through your academic career, you can and should explore aspects of design that you find exciting and fulfilling. A maker bears a responsibility to know the implications of their work and how other people are ultimately affected. In this degree program, you will examine design as it relates to digital tools and skills needed for storytelling, products and artifacts, interaction and experiences, and the production and dissemination of knowledge.\nDMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations will expose you to a broad design perspective so that you can apply it as a conceptual frame for your studies. In other words, even though you will be studying content not specifically talking about design, you will be able to understand the relationship between what you are learning and the larger context of design. After you complete DMD 100 and other prescribed courses, you will enroll in other courses that will help develop digital production skills, build awareness to contemporary issues, and locate historical context. Once you have explored relevant subject matter in other courses, you will be ready to rejoin the DMD major courses to synthesize your interests and skills into projects.\nIn DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio, you will apply your experiences from previous coursework to narrow your focus while producing projects in collaboration with your peers. DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone is the capstone course in which you will create an entirely self-directed design project for inclusion in an online thesis project exhibition.\nMission\nThe Digital Multimedia Design Program promotes the values of imagination and creativity as human resources. Digital media generally refers to the storage and transmission of information in increasingly varied multimedia digital formats and devices, and within a changing array of modes of communication. Design is a means by which we respond to change in a purposeful way. By focusing on critical issues and opportunities, designers develop plans for taking innovative and strategic actions. Hence, digital design shapes and impacts the physical and virtual spaces people inhabit. Over the course of this program, you will produce projects that stimulate sound habits of mind, develop proficiencies of practice, and foster critical sensibilities for addressing issues.\nDMD Core\nThe program is comprised of three program-exclusive spine courses and six prescribed (required) \"core\" courses – two from each contributing college: Arts & Architecture, Communications, and Information Sciences & Technology. The core courses will provide skills and context pertinent to the disciplines from which they reside. The spine courses provide opportunities to frame and combine experiences from these disciplines.\nPathways\nThough design is part of the core identity of the program, each student will develop their own pathway. A pathway is literally a sequence of courses. However, you have great control over choosing which courses to combine into your sequence. To help you get started, there are pre-made course sequences available on the DMD Program Hub (dmd.psu.edu).\nProjects\nYou will develop capabilities necessary to use digital technologies in multimedia projects in prescribed, supporting, and additional courses. DMD 100 projects are designed for students with limited knowledge of digital production technology, but introduces foundational design knowledge that can be applied to all future DMD coursework. Final projects in the capstone course will be made available as part of portfolios and an online exhibition.\nPortfolios\nDeveloping a creative digital portfolio of work that showcases your interest areas and capabilities will become an essential component for professional development. More information on portfolios will become available on the DMD Program Hub website.\nCitation\n\nhttps://installingorder.org/2013/03/27/sts-program-at-penn-state/\n\n"},"introduction/instructor.html":{"url":"introduction/instructor.html","title":"Course instructor","keywords":"","body":"Course instructor\n\nMichael Collins\nE-Mail: msc227@psu.edu\nTwitter: @_mike_collins\nMichael Collins joined the Penn State School of Visual Arts in 2012 where he teaches 3D animation, digital design, and digital fabrication.

Some key requirements of achieving success are not overtly teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining what success looks like is difficult, as the qualities of a successful student can be different in given contexts. Therefore, to have a universal measurement system that works to any degree of accuracy often means that objective and quantifiable metrics are chosen over subjective and qualitative metrics – and the former of which may be poor indicators of success for a multifaceted design program. In other words, the nature of real learning limits what we can reasonably measure.\nIn many educational institutions, the grade point average (GPA) measures a student's ability to meet the success metrics as set by an instructor or governing assessment entity. There may be some correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job or start a business, become well-rounded, or be prepared for the unexpected challenges ahead. A student's attitude and grit are the best indications of success after graduation.\nI have assembled a list that attempts to describe the attitudes and attributes that are likely to indicate success:\n\nAdaptability\nShift mental models to approach problems differently\nRapidly identify and learn required knowledge\nDon't be too adaptable \n\n\nUnderstanding\nExplore a wide array of perspectives\nDeconstruct complexity into less complex parts\nContextualize issues within larger systems\nBe curious\nDon't take feedback personally or at face value\n\n\nFocus\nPrioritize essential tasks\nBe aware of capabilities and limitations\nIdentify and clear away distractions \n\n\nPerseverance (grit)\nDon't give up; do what you can with what you have\nDedicate time and energy\nFinish what you start\nPractice unwavering optimism (self-effacacy)\nFail fast to eventually succeed\n\n\nSkill\nDevelop intellectual capabilities\nAchieve technical mastery\nCommunicate appropriately with respective audiences\n\n\nEmpathy\nPut yourself in someone's shoes to better understand why we design\nTalk to people you want to design for\nListen, question, and defer judgement\n\n\n\n"},"introduction/learning-objectives.html":{"url":"introduction/learning-objectives.html","title":"Learning objectives","keywords":"","body":"Learning Objectives\nStudents completing DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations will be able to do the following:\n\nObjectives related to developing Process and Procedural Skills (Designing)\nIntegrate skills, knowledge, and creative practices in digital media in exploratory exercises that draw on content and methods from information sciences and technology, communications, and visual arts and design.\nUse digital technologies in multimedia projects through exploration, expression, and communication that engage a multiplicity of ideas, forms, actions, and settings.\nGather and analyze information from research sources to identify and apply relevant content that can aid concept development, improve design processes and products.\n\n\nObjectives related to developing Critical Skills (Critiquing)\nAdapt an interdisciplinary vocabulary of terms, methods, and processes to review applying information and critique ideas in individual contexts and collaborative settings\nDemonstrate communication skills by creating and presenting ideas, concepts, and designs in written, verbal, and visual forms.\nImplement new ideas and develop a diverse array of options for problem solving in response to critical review and the iterative design process for improving work.\n\n\nObjectives related to developing Attitudes and Awareness (Assessing context)\nRecognize how influences, constraints, personal interests, ethics, and resources impact design decisions and creative options.\n\n\n\n"},"introduction/projects.html":{"url":"introduction/projects.html","title":"Projects","keywords":"","body":"Projects\nDMD 100 has three projects, one in user experience and interface prototyping, interactive storytelling, and open product design.

If someone gives you ambiguous feedback, this means that they can intuitively see a weakness but might not know why something isn't working. You should follow up with their comments with probing questions to better understand their perspective.\nIf an instructor gives you advice and that they want you to do something, you should try it and see if it works. If it doesn't work well, then bring that up in the next critique. The instructor is not responsible for the choices you make when creating work, only for guiding and responding to those choices. If you make work that is sub-par as a result of the instructor asking you to try something, don't blame the instructor. You should have the ability to identify emergent weaknesses that the instructor did not anticipate, and pivot before showing that work in the next critique.\nInterpreting feedback\nLet's say you just pulled an all-nighter to get a project finished (unfortunately very common for art and design students). It's a masterpiece, and you can't wait to unveil it to unfettered acclaim from your peers. However, you show your work to everyone, and the response you get does not sound like praise. In fact, they say things like \"it's not working\" or \"I don't understand why you did that ...\" and you are devastated.\nUnless you had brutally honest parents growing up, you might not be used to a negative response to your creative work, particularly work in which you have invested considerable effort. Letting go of emotional attachment to your work will greatly help you with the ability to self-evaluate more objectively. That \"eye\" that people mention that perhaps got you into the field in the first place comes from this ability to objectively evaluate. Praise can certainly happen in feedback or critique and is a great way to communicate when you've done something well, but you should remain skeptical of too much praise. Unwarranted praise can really hold your work back, blinding you from where your weaknesses lie. If your work needs improvement, you need to know about it in order to improve, and this is the main goal of feedback.\nThough feedback typically centers on your work, sometimes comments are aimed at you and not your work. The emotional trauma of being criticized can be painful. Step back and remind yourself that the purpose of the feedback is to help and encourage you, not to be condescending or cruel. This objectivity is really important so that you can learn from the feedback. Some students have trouble trying anything outside of their comfort zone. This is often obvious in a feedback session or critique. Signs include defensiveness to negative feedback, sense of arrogance or overconfidence, dismissal of instructor comments or suggestions, and outright refusal to make changes according to feedback. This is not a professional attitude or outlook, and will keep you from the opportunities that will grow you as an artist or designer. Failure must happen rapidly so you can improve at a quick pace. Closed-mindedness causes failure to happen slowly over a long period of time. Your instructors are genuinely invested in your success and it is their job to point out shortcomings. Most student interpretations of overt \"insensitivity\" or \"hardness\" by an instructor typically results from a situation such as the one described.\nGiving feedback\nKeep it positive. A tried and true technique for feedback, where appropriate, is called the \"critique sandwich.\" This is the Happy Meal of the critique process. Essentially, you will start and end a critique with positive comments (the bread), using the comments in between (the meat or meat-flavored tofu) for the important, possibly negative-sounding feedback. This makes hard-to-swallow comments more palatable, yet still communicates the important issues.\nTrolling\nAnyone can intentionally or unintentionally become a troll. A troll is a person who is intent on disrupting constructive discussion by posting inflammatory remarks to halt the progress of a discussion — typically for the purpose of self-amusement or for the emotional high of winning an argument. This happens in online (and sometimes offline) spaces that lack established social norms or policy enforcement.\nIn an academic setting, the instructor sets the social norms of the classroom and maintains authority over moderating a discussion. It is not an instructor's job to be \"thought police.\" Therefore, if a student has an opinion that is counter to the general opinions of the class, voicing those opinions are encouraged to provoke thoughtful discussion. However, disrespectful remarks meant to oppress another student will be considered trolling behavior and will not be allowed to continue without consequence.\nTrolling is the antithetical to meaningful discussion and learning, so try to be mindful that your remarks (possibly being written under some emotional stress) don't accidentally veer off course and shut down a potentially helpful conversation.\n"},"introduction/technology.html":{"url":"introduction/technology.html","title":"Technology","keywords":"","body":"\nTechnology\nKeep your data safe\nConspiring forces are working right now to destroy your data.

Natural language is fine in this stage, and even desired for personal stories. When providing feedback on drafts, try not to nitpick on spelling and grammar, but rather the content, insights, and direction of the concepts.\nFinal deliverables\nTypically, a final deliverable will be evaluated according to all possible metrics.

Grudin attempts to describe what design is and connect it to philosophy, ethics, economics, governance, education, and notions of truth. I have assigned reading responses for each book chapter so you can begin connecting ideas from the book to your personal experiences and perceptions.

Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer of some kind. The degree of care for each designed artifact or system can vary dramatically causing you to experience delight, dismay, and everything in between. As design moved out of the studio and into the boardroom, the design field has grown larger in scope, and has become a tool for civic engagement and change. For this reason, a variety of ideas about what design is, how you do it, and what makes it good have emerged. I've located a few descriptions for us to compare.\nIn the book, Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social Change, Victor Papanek writes a rather broad definition of design: \"Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order.\" We get another, even more broad definition from Robert Grudin's book, Design and Truth: \"The primary function of design is to shape and channel energy.\"\nI think we can go even broader. I will now attempt to define the broadest definitions of design possible with the English language. At the broadest sense of design as a verb, design is the act of creating or making a choice. In the broadest sense of design as a noun, design is the result of a choice or series of choices.\nAll of these definitions are better understood after you have been doing design for a long time and are perhaps less useful when trying to learn how to do it. Therefore, for the purposes of teaching a person how to do design, we can consider this the working definition — design is the process that helps a person or group create, select, modify, and organize elements to satisfy an intended outcome. When paired with a given field of study, we can narrow the kinds of choices a designer will have to make, and subsequently better understand the scope of their thinking. As helpful as definitions are, the downside is that they begin to silo the field. The act of siloing study into fields is a kind of violence towards design – forcing designers to ignore the forces and systems with which it aught to be concerned. With that warning out of the way, let's take a look at some lists that might give us some insight to what good design is.\nGood design in list form\nFamed industrial designer, Dieter Rams, has written a rather popular list of what makes for good product design, aptly called \"Ten principles for good design.\" [1] It follows:\n\nGood design is innovative\nGood design makes a product useful\nGood design is aesthetic\nGood design makes a product understandable\nGood design is unobtrusive\nGood design is honest\nGood design is long lasting\nGood design is thorough down to the last detail\nGood design is environmentally friendly\nGood design is as little design as possible\n\n\nBraun RT 20 Radio designed by Dieter Rams in 1961. Image by Nick Wade.[2]\nOn page 29 in Design and Truth, Robert Grudin assembles a slightly longer list:\n\nGood design is in accord with nature and human nature\nGood design is in harmony with its immediate surroundings\nGood design converses with contingent technologies\nGood design helps to develop skill and/or imparts knowledge\nGood design extends a user's sensibilities and freedom\nGood design projects simplicity\nGood design minimizes difficulties and dangers\nGood design conveys a sense of beauty\nGood design gives pleasure to use\nGood design is not unreasonably expensive\nGood design is sustainable\nGood design allows a user to perform optimally in engaging reality\nGood design can be delivered, installed, and repaired conveniently\n\nWhile inspiring, these lists do little to explain the process behind good design work. A design studio called Intrastructures has written a list that explains what actions of design means to them, and the approaches that drive their design process. From their website [3], \"We define design as...\n\nDissecting ubiquity. Remaining curious to the obvious\nManaging complexity. Mapping our contemporary infrastructure in order to reveal opportunities\nIntroducing proposition. Changing from within rather than shouting from the outside\nAbandoning the individual. Sharing our mind, sketchbooks and hard drives\nSpreading enthusiasm. Not fearing radical optimism\nBridging disciplines.

Acting by both thinking and doing\"\n\nThese lists were not meant to be hard rules that apply to everything, but they can be helpful guidelines and mission statements when making or evaluating design.\nUnderstanding design, art, and media\nEduardo Navas is an artist and art historian whose research centers around media production and remix theory. He describes the contemporary role of media design for digital studio art practices:\n“‘Media Design’ in particular, is an interdisciplinary practice in the visual and fine arts because historically, as the term currently functions derives from new media, which in the 90s and early 2000s made possible cross-disciplinary experimentation across art and design. The terms new media art and new media design were sometimes interchangeable in casual language by practitioners who crossed over art and commercial design practice as freelancers and artists. Out of this evolution the term media design connotes something quite different from graphic design as it is commonly understood in terms of careers and professions.\n[...] the concept of design is not exclusive to a monolithic field. When it is by itself, it connotes  abstract creative processes and methods that can be part of any type of material production–the most common one historically has been art itself. This began to change as we know in the twentieth century after the Bauhaus developed more specific approaches to art and design as specific creative concepts that for them were closely intertwined. The term design when combined with another term, such as the ones mentioned above, today functions as a very important concept to be used to describe interdisciplinarity within specializations that are by no means insulated, and are constantly influencing each other.”\nCitations\n\nhttps://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design (Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0)\nWade, Nick.

Generally speaking, design thinking refers the methods used to strategically guide a person or group to question underlying assumptions, generate a large array of ideas, better understand user needs, synthesize prototypes, propose or build viable solutions, and more. Its roots can be traced to Participatory Design, User-Centered Design, Service Design, and Human-Centered Design. Imagining a new idea, let alone 100 new ideas, is hard and often comes with overcoming learned blocks to creative thinking. To make this process easier, modern design thinking methods tend to incorporate synectics, or methods that facilitate the connection of ideas through unrelated phenomenon.\nDesign blocks\nYou can think of design blocks as a kind of enemy to good design. A design block is a mental, cultural, or social hinderance to finding solutions that stray from norms and assumed knowledge and ideas. Without a willingness to push beyond what is assumed, change will be a very slow process. As Victor Papanek writes in Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social Change, \"We live in a society that penalizes highly creative individuals for their non-conformist autonomy. This makes the teaching of problem-solving discouraging and difficult. A 22-two-year-old student arrives at school with massive blocks against new ways of thinking, engendered by some 16 years of miseducation, a heritage of childhood and pubescence of being \"molded,\" \"adjusted,\" \"shaped.\" Meanwhile our society continuously evolves new social patterns that promise a slight departure from the mainstream but without ever endangering the patchwork of marginal groups that make up society as a whole.\"\nWhether they are a subject-matter expert or a layperson, everyone faces implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) biases that can cause misinterpretations, false assumptions, and an over-reliance on common and familiar paths to a solution. \"That is the way it has always been done\" or \"it's just common sense\" are common expressions used by someone who is operating with a common bias called Confirmation Bias. A bias, like a design block, can undermine innovative problem solving and inhibit creative thinking. Modern design processes attempt to identify where bias may exist and prevent it from harming the outcome.\nOn page 158 in Victor Papanek's Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social  Change, he lists seven types of blocks, some of which are based on bias, and some of which are internal or external pressures:\n\nWe can list the inhibitors that keep us from solving tasks in new and innovative ways. They are:\n\nPerceptual\nEmotional\nAssociational\nCultural\nProfessional\nIntellectual\nEnvironmental\n\n\nBeginner's mindset\nA designer's approach to questioning of assumptions, known as the beginners mindset, is helpful for bypassing stereotypes and misconceptions that often inhibit empathetic discoveries. How a person acquires the beginner's mindset can vary. Here is an example from the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford: [2]\n\nDon’t judge. Just observe and engage users without the influence of value judgments upon their actions, circumstances, decisions, or “issues.”\nQuestion everything. Question even (and especially) the things you think you already understand. Ask questions to learn about how the user perceives the world. Follow up an answer to one “why” with a second “why.”\nBe truly curious. Strive to assume a posture of wonder and curiosity, especially in circumstances that seem either familiar or uncomfortable.\nFind patterns. Look for interesting threads and themes that emerge across interactions with users.\nListen. Really.\n\nOn page 172 in Victor Papanek's Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social  Change, he lists eight methods to eliminate blocks:\n\nOur job then becomes one of establishing methods of doing away with these blocks. Although it is difficult to make a definitive list, since there is enormous overlap between different methods, I shall list eight:\n\nBrainstorming\nSynectics\nMorphological analysis\nSliding Scales\nBisociation\nTrisociation\nBionics and Biomechanics\nForcing New Thinking Patterns\n\n\nWe won't go into detail about what each of Papanek's methods are; however, we will practice a few of them when completing course projects. There are hundreds of quantitative and qualitative design and research methods to choose from. The book, Universal Methods of Design by Bella Martin and Bruce Hanington, is a good starting point.\nEmbracing V.U.C.A.\n\nNow change seems to be much more unpredictable; it exceeds what we have known in the past. As we view the world, we realize organizations reflect society and political needs, which accommodate expanding democracy and periods of turmoil. Bureaucracies may remain the foundation for basic stability during these periods of rapid change, but they will have to be more open and adaptable to be effective – or even to survive. [2]\n\nCritical design failures tend to occur when tried-and-true processes, procedures, and policies are applied to solve a problem in an environment that is undergoing change. In these environments, creative problem solving and innovation are needed to address this change. The value of design thinking comes from its ability to deal in uncertainty in a dynamic environment. The acronym, V.U.C.A., created by the U.S. Army War College, describes this phenomenon – volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.\nVolatility refers to the anticipated type, speed, volume, and scale of change. Uncertainty refers to the idea that due to the volatile surroundings, future events can no longer be predicted. Complexity is described as widespread confusion and seemingly no clear connection between cause and effect. Ambiguity arises from the existence of multiple meanings and misinterpretations of reality.\nRole of Heuristics\nA heuristic is essentially a shortcut that helps you solve a problem quickly. You can see an example of a heuristic device, originally developed by renaissance master painters, implemented on modern digital cameras. Typically, there is a setting to overlay a Rule of Thirds grid on the camera screen, which displays two vertical and horizontal lines creating nine equal rectangles. As it turns out, if you line up your subject on one of the thirds lines, or place a high contrast object at one of the intersections, you are more likely to take a picture with good composition. Just like a visual design heuristic, there are also many cognitive heuristics to help you remember facts, do math, and particularly relevant to a designer, generate new ideas and interesting ideas. Many creative thinkers develop their own heuristic rules or devices to help them produce work.\nDesign thinking processes equip designers with heuristic devices that help us avoid implicit or explicit bias, form connections between new and existing ideas, understand underlying issues and themes, be more inclusive and wider in perspective, and get better outcomes and solutions. Without heuristic devices, the act of design would be a very long and inefficient process, and we might never be able to overcome the blocks to good design.\nThe Business Case for Design Thinking\nJess McMullin, founder of the Centre for Citizen Experience and Situ Strategy, describes a continuum of design maturity for organizations in his model, A Rough Design Maturity Continuum.  There are five stages which range from having no strategic design to using design for identifying and framing central challenges and opportunities.\n\nNo conscious design: The organization has assigned no value or priority to design. The product that results is deemed good enough.\nStyle: Design is considered a secondary cosmetic process that makes a product more palatable for consumption. Aesthetic trends drive products.\nFunction and Form: Design is applied as part of an iterative improvement process for product development. Metrics and methods drive products.\nProblem solving: Design is used in strategic processes for identifying opportunities, generating an array of ideas, and selecting solutions for existing problems. Problems drive products.\nFraming: Design drives disruptive innovation. Design is used to frame the organization's agenda, and to scope interest. Ideas drive products.\n\nThe organizations that incorporate design into the framing and problem solving end of the design maturity continuum are highlighted in the Design Value Index (DVI). The superior performance of the index in relation to the S&P 500 is used to make the case not only for investing in design-driven companies, but as further evidence for why design should take a larger role within large organizations.\nCitation\n\nDesign and Thinking.

Systems are bounded, can be nested, overlap with other systems, are autonomous in operation, parts can be distributed or co-located, can interact with the larger environment, and tend to be invisible.\nDesign can happen at every scale. At the small scale, humans can collide single atoms together to investigate theoretical physics or to create very large bombs. At the large scale, complex social and technological systems can impact the global climate affecting every living organism on Earth. Understanding the scale you are designing for will have many implications for your process and design outcomes. Systems thinking plays an essential role when designing for large scale, as there are many forces that will affect your design that are out of your control.\nIf you consider that an expert in any given field is an expert on the system or systems situated in that field, then people who work across systems from different fields can be considered to be transdisciplinary. A transdisciplinarian is a multi-systems worker and takes liberty to follow the networked paths for more holistic perspectives on problems and issues.\nCradle to Cradle\nWhen thinking about a model to aid sustainable design, the term Cradle to Cradle Design was coined by German chemist Michael Braungart and U.S. architect William McDonough in their book, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. Cradle to Cradle Design accounts for wellness, social, economic, and ecological systems in the design model when producing consumer products, infrastructure, and services. The Cradle to Cradle Design model is a shift in perspective on the traditional product lifecycle – known as Cradle to Grave, a model where products eventually cease to be useful – and instead imagine how products can be made of biological or technical \"nutrients\" that are reused over and over. As a proof of concept, their 2002 book was printed on special synthetic paper, intended to be an example of a technical nutrient.\n\nThis book is not a tree.It is printed on synthetic \"paper\" and bound into a book format developed by innovative book packager Charles Melcher of Melcher Media. Unlike the paper which we are familiar, it does not use any wood pulp or cotton fiber but is made from plastic resins and inorganic fillers. This material is not only waterproof, extremely durable, and (in many localities) recyclable by conventional means; it is also a prototype for the book as a \"technical nutrient,\" that is, as a product that can be broken down and circulated infinitely in industrial cycles–made and re-made as \"paper\" or other products.[1]\n\nThe \"S\" word\nThe Designers Accord was a five-year project that culminated in the development of guiding principles and methodologies for integrating sustainability into design and teaching. This was done through design community engagement, networking, and by inspiring designers to share case studies, best practices, and ideas at hosted events. The guiding methodology numbered items:\n\nPublicly declare participation in the Designers Accord.\nInitiate a dialogue about environmental and social impact and sustainable alternatives with each and every client. Rework client contracts to favor environmentally and socially responsible design and work processes. Provide strategic and material alternatives for sustainable design.\nUndertake a program to educate your teams about sustainability and sustainable design.\nConsider your ethical footprint. Understand the impact of your firm, and work to measure, manage, and reduce it on an annual basis.\nAdvance the understanding of environmental and social issues from a design perspective by actively contributing to the communal knowledge base for sustainable design.\n\n\nThe “S” word\nTalking about sustainable design is not the best way to talk about it.\nFocus on leadership skills, participation, transparency, engagement, networks, human centered design, respect, and active listening. Ask students to rethink current paradigms and to envision a better future. [1]\n\nThe educational toolkit also recommends that you do not use the word sustainability when incorporating it into a curriculum, and I have followed this recommendation for the most part within course projects and other assignments. Sustainability is a central part to all good design, though it's not specifically referenced. The Designers Accord is a clear example of an organized initiative to get designers thinking more systemically in terms of environmental and social impact.\nThe problem of the ‘hyperobject’\nNow, let us consider the issue of large congregations of plastic in the sea, described on the website for the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):\nHow Big Is the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\"? Science vs. Myth (External Website)\nEssentially, there is a ton of discarded waste plastic that has found its way into the Pacific Ocean, and it is negatively impacting wildlife. Let's explore this issue through a bit of speculation. Where did the plastic come from, how did it find its way to the sea, and who might have been involved in this process? To answer these questions, we would have to imagine the shape and scope of the networked system. No actual research was performed for this speculation, but the proposed ideas are reasonable enough for the purposes of this example. In a real study, citations would certainly be required:\n\nIndustrial producers: Material design, Engineering Design\nAvailability of cheap crude-oil makes plastic easy and cheap to produce\n\n\nBusiness and economics: Business and Product Design\nFinancial markets trade heavily in crude oil (from which plastic is made)\nAvailability of cheap plastic materials and mass production technology\nBusiness goals and values do not align with minimizing impact to existing ecological system\n\n\nPublic consensus: Public Relations and Marketing design\nAd campaigns infiltrate popular culture\nWastefulness is widely accepted and normalized\nMarketing campaigns are effective at selling products\n\n\nWaste management processes: Service Design\nWastefulness is good for business\nNo real long-term ecological considerations for disposal\n\n\nGovernment: Policy Design\nSpecial interest lobbying prevents ecological policies from hindering the sale of products\nIssue not prioritized by society\nRecycling initiatives are not timely and universally ineffective\n\n\n\nSupposing this list was accurate, the next step would to be to better understand the systems in which each participant was embedded so that we may clarify underlying systemic issues. Being able to comprehend and perceive an entire interconnected network is admittedly not easy. This idea becomes more apparent when considering the amount of people who disagree on the cause and effect responsible for the breakdown of a system. Modern examples of system breakdown include the 2008 global recession, man-made climate change, and the British exit of the European Union.\nCritic Timothy Morton calls these systems hyperobjects. They are objects so large and complex, that humans can not perceive them in their entirety.\n\n\"The problem is bigger, it’s a system.” Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a “hyperobject.” Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it’s everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a “to-do” list that’s never consulted again. [3]\n\n‘Wicked’ problems\nTo adequately describe the difficulty of designing policies to fix complex social issues, UC Berkeley professors Horst Rittel and Melvin M. Webber formalized theory in a 1973 publication around the term “wicked problem.” It describes problems that are not only difficult to define, but also inherently unsolvable. They defined the following 10 characteristics of wicked problems:\n\nA wicked problem has no particular form. (I.e. Poverty in one country is different from poverty in another, etc.)\nWicked problems can be worked on indefinitely. (Until resourced run out)\nSubjectively good or bad rather than objectively true or false.\nNo means to immediately and fully test solutions.\nImplementing solutions changes the problem, and are therefore “one-shot” operations rather than trial and error.\nNo criteria to indicate if all solutions have been identified.\nEvery wicked problem is unique. (Problem solving process is always new)\nWicked problems are symptoms of other problems. (Interconnected complex systems)\nHow the problem is framed dictates how the problem is solved. (Bias heavily influences approach)\nPlanners are responsible for negative outcomes that result from the actions they take. (The stakes are high)\n\n[4]\nThis list might sound daunting, but don't despair – these are not necessarily unsolvable problems. Designers have been developing ways to attack the wicked problem for many years. These problems are where design thinkers and interdisciplinarian workers situate themselves.

Critical thinking is not the rote memorization and retention of information. Its aim to achieve the best possible outcome for a given situation.\n\nCritical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It requires rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism.\n– Richard Paul Linda Elder [1]\n\nCritical thinking is a rational and intellectual endeavor. Someone practiced in critical thinking can make well-constructed arguments, locate logical fallacies, connect ideas to draw conclusions, and identify bias. A critical thinker without ethical integrity would seek to manipulate others for the sake of their own benefit. One who is ignorant to critical thinking skills would be easy prey to such a person, thereby reinforcing critical thinking as a requisite work and life skill in any modern society. It is also an imperative skill for social, cultural, political, and technological leaders to guide society in a purposeful and beneficial way.\nConstructing arguments\nAn argument is comprised of a premise, supporting evidence, and conclusions. In a design critique, constructive arguments are meant to aid in the technical, contextual, and conceptual understanding of the design process and outcome. Four typical kinds of logic arguments include deductive arguments, inductive arguments, abductive arguments, and analogy arguments. Deductive arguments rely on direct logical connections and fall apart if the premises are proven incorrect. Inductive arguments rely on general observations and grow weaker with every observed counterexample. Abductive argument conclusions are a best available explanation for all available facts and data, connecting evidence that directly and indirectly confirms the argument. An analogy argument produces a conclusion based on another conclusion from a similar issue.[2]\nIn design, it is typically undesirable to have a pre-determined conclusion or outcome ahead of seeing the premises and discovering evidence. Assumptions and pre-determined conclusions can undermine innovation and invention. The term \"ripping the brief\" describes a design process where a designer or design team will question the project's premises to locate any false or problematic assumptions. Design thinking and research is done to dig up evidence to guide design decisions (conclusions). In storytelling, a well constructed story is often a well constructed argument that focuses on a central theme or issue. For many film viewers, poor visual effects or a departure from plausibility breaks the premise that what you are watching is real, and pulls you out of the illusion.\nEthics\nEthics is a rational study of moral dilemmas within human action and thought. Morals are codes of conduct defined by personal or socially-imposed beliefs and values. Ethical studies help ascribe an act to be considered moral, immoral or amoral. To be moral, the action or thought must be within established codes. An immoral act is a thought or action that disregards established moral codes. An amoral act or thought has no relevance to established codes.[2]\nEthics issues are also design issues because design is an aspect of human action that can have dramatic consequences to a person's livelihood and mortality. For example, Facebook has come under fire in recent years for running experiments meant to manipulate their user's moods and implementing privacy controls that automatically revealed private information to a users's personal network. If designed carelessly, social media can inadvertently enable bullying, push certain at-risk individuals to suicide, cause the loss of employment, expose minorities and people of alternative lifestyles to mortal danger, and negatively affect familial relationships. Examples of these consequences are well documented and make a compelling case that design decisions in the tech industry are failing ethics tests.\nVictor Papanek published the book, Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change in 1971, where he connected problematic ethics and sustainability issues to the role of the designer. He was met with tremendous backlash by the design community. He was asked to resign from professional design associations and his work was publicly ridiculed. However, in the years since, Papanek's ideas have gained widespread acceptance, and Design for the Real World is now a required text in many design and architecture programs. In a chapter titled Do-it-Yourself Murder: Social and Moral Responsibilities of Design, Papanek writes,  \"The designer's ... social and moral judgment must be brought into play long before he begins to design, since he has to make a judgment, an a priori at that, as to whether the products he is asked to design or redesign merit his attention at all. In other words, will his design be on the side of social good or not.\"[3]\nA speculative near-future science fiction television series produced in the UK, called Black Mirror, delves into a world where ethics are a secondary consideration to technological advancement. In some cases, the scenarios are already in play in certain parts of the world, including a new credit score initiative in China which closely matches the plot of a Black Mirror episode called \"Nosedive.\"\nCritical Making\n\nOpen design heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars, and interested citizens to engage in a simultaneously conceptual and material critique of technologies and information systems in society.[4]\n\nThe term 'critical making' is intended to highlight the interwoven material and conceptual work that making involves. As a teaching and research strategy, critical making shares an emphasis on values with both critical design and critical practices — such as the critical technical practice[5] from which it derives, as well as value-sensitive-design[6] and values-in-design.[7]\nCitation\n\nRichard Paul and Linda Elder, The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking Concepts and Tools, Foundation for Critical Thinking Press, 2008\nCondensed and adapted from: A quick primer for ethics in design. http://mlab.uiah.fi/polut/Yhteiskunnalliset/lisatieto_ethics_primer.html\nPapanek, V.

If you don't know where to start, identifying, learning, and practicing those established guidelines makes good sense. If you are a seasoned designer, then adapting a process according to your own experiences is prudent, and something you would be used to doing. Innovating on an existing design process from the very start may be more inhibiting than helpful.\n\nIn this course, we will be adapting and simplifying a design process model called the Double Diamond, originally created by the British Design Council, and reimagined by Dan Nessler. The shape of a two-dimensional diamond is meant to be visual analogy describing the divergence and convergence of ideas. Read from left to right, you would use divergent thinking methods to create an array of possibilities, and then use convergent thinking methods to arrive as a specific outcome or decision.\nDivergent and convergent thinking\nDivergent thinking refers to the thought processes that are used for producing an array of ideas that may be quite different from each other. This kind of thinking is meant to generate an abundance of possibilities to increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Creative thinkers are particularly skilled divergent thinkers, drawing inspiration from unexpected sources and keen observations.\nConvergent thinking refers to the thought processes involved with resolving an idea or solution. A convergent thinking will analyze an idea's viability with respect to available resources, capabilities, human-factors implications, environmental considerations, cost, efficiency, and many other metrics. Engineers tend to excel in convergent thinking, choosing the best options from set of possibilities.\nThe Four Phases\n\nOn the Double Diamond Phases diagram, you can see how two connected diamonds describe four phases, two divergent, and two convergent. The red arrows pointing away from each other represent divergence whereas the red arrows pointed towards each other represent convergence. In the left-most diamond, you would establish an understanding of the prompt and a solution plan. In the right-most diamond, you would construct the response to the prompt. Each diamond is divided into two parts, creating four design phases which we will refer to throughout course projects.\nThe (1) Discover phase is where you will gain a better understanding of the project and its goals; the (2) Define phase is where you will narrow and form the project's direction; the (3) Develop phase is where you will explore production methodologies, prototype, and experiment; and finally the (4) Deliver phase is where you will iterate and refine your project.  This process model will be used to complete projects with an added discussion phase at the end. Though this process is not necessarily a linear methodology, we will be progressing through projects in a linear fashion.\nAt any given part of this process, you may be asked to give form to the work you are doing. You should be prepared to communicate progress verbally and visually, giving equal importance and attention to in-process work as is given to the final product.\n1. Discover\nThe discovery phase is all about questioning and researching. To better understand the nature of a problem later in the process, it is helpful to gather as much raw information and data as possible.\nResearch\nAlmost any design process will have some research component. Qualitative research refers to open-ended and unstructured research that can be obtained through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, and exploration. This type of data is descriptive and more difficult to analyze. Quantitative research deals in data that is measured and tends to be easier to process. Correlations, causal relationships, and trends interpreted from findings are subject to the researchers bias and assumptions.\nEthnographic research is concerned with learning about how people live their lives, and ethnography techniques are often used in human-centered design. You can obtain this by doing field work, a kind of primary research where you make observations, conduct interviews, and more, or by doing secondary research which typically involves book or Internet searches for existing information.\n2. Define\nWith research completed, you can now focus on identifying underlying themes and forming concepts. The end of this phase usually culminates in a How Might We (HMW) question, where the end-goal of the project then becomes trying to answer the question.\nArticulating the true nature of a problem in this phase helps ensure that the design process is genuinely concerned about the presented or generated issue, and serves as inspiration for the rest of design process.\n3. Develop\nIn this phase you think of an array of possible ways to solve for the project goals worked out in the Define phase.  You use design thinking strategies, prototyping, storytelling, and other methods to identify as many ideas as you can.\n4. Deliver\nIn this phase, you build, test, and iterate a solution. Maintaining an open dialogue and getting feedback is important to ensure the work as as good as it can be. At the end of this phase, you are able to make an assertion or provide a functioning or complete solution.\n"},"reading-reflections/chapter_1_sen_rikyu_and_the_paradox_of_innovation.html":{"url":"reading-reflections/chapter_1_sen_rikyu_and_the_paradox_of_innovation.html","title":"Chapter 1&2.

Vibrantly colored insects may indicate that they are poisonous to predators while bird songs, feathers, and nests communicate sexual fitness to prospective mates. Humans are no different, displaying or obscuring attributes for the same ends. These are semiotic processes. Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and their interpretation. [3] The study of semiotic processes are just as relevant in art as they are in computer science. There are many contributors to the field of semiotics, including Roland Barthes and Umberto Eco.\nSigns\nA sign is composed of a signifier and signified. A signifier is the form of the sign and can be auditory, visual, or physical in nature. A famous play on this idea is the René Magritte painting entitled, The Treachery of Images, where he has painted a pipe above the words, \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\" (translation: \"This is not a pipe.\")[2] In the painting, Magritte paints an iconic image of a pipe, but contradicts the very idea that the image is a pipe with written text. Depending on what the viewer feels is a stronger signifier, they will believe either the text or the image to be true. To understand how a sign is produced, let's look at an excerpt from Eco's Theory of Semiotics:\n\nWhat happens when I produce a sign or a string of signs? First of all, I must accomplish a task purely in terms of physical stress, for I have to ‘utter’. Utterances are usually considered as emissions of sounds, but one may enlarge this notion and consider as ‘utterances’ any production of signals. Thus I utter when I draw an image, when I make a purposeful gesture or when I produce an object that, besides its technical function, aims to communicate something.[1]\n\nThe three categories of signifiers are the (1) Icon, (2) Symbol and (3) Index. An icon resembles some physical attribute of the signified. A symbol is an arbitrary form that is connected to the signified only through cultural association and convention. The fact that you can understand this text is because it is a symbol that you have learned to connect to its corresponding meaning. An index is some manifestation or result of the existence of the signified. For instance, a traffic cone on the highway is an index for a construction zone being present.\nThe signified is the conceptual idea. If you were to write the word spoon, that word would be a symbol that signifies the referenced object, spoon.\nSemiotics is fairly paradoxical, as it is intrinsically linked to culture. To understand why, see the following video collaboration between VOX and 99% Invisible, called Beyond Biohazard: Why Danger Symbols Can't Last Forever.\nSemantics\nConceptual semantics focuses on understanding how meaning is formed cognitively. If we look at a diagram of the Meaning Triangle, we can see that there is a sign—an icon, symbol, or index—which in the example in the diagram is written as the symbol \"spoon.\" The concept of a spoon is the thought or mental act associated with referring to the spoon object. The object, also known as a referent, does not have to be a physical thing, just something that is being referred to.\n\nWhenever someone produces something that others will interact with, they are playing in the semiotic realm, and an understanding of these mechanics will help a designer communicate more effectively.\nCitations\n\nECO, UMBERTO. “THEORY OF SIGN PRODUCTION.” A Theory of Semiotics, Indiana University Press, 1976, pp. 151–313, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16xwcfd.8.

Inclusive design, also known as universal design, is design that takes all people into account, including \"extreme users.\" Extreme users typically have physical or cognitive differences or limitations that the majority of design does not account for. These users tend to make up a small percentage of users, and have needs that are often not considered in profit-centric businesses. It can be very expensive to revamp an existing design to meet the needs of extreme users, and design standards are only starting to catch up. For web design, inclusive design is better known as accessible design, and has made considerable advances in the last decade or so as a result of government regulations and lawsuits, most notable a National Federation of the Blind's 2010 complaint against Penn State University which has since led to massive infrastructure and policy overhauls.\nAn obvious example of inclusive design in the built environment are building codes that require the inclusion of wheelchair ramps, minimum dimensions for doors and hallways, ceiling heights, fire escapes, railings, etc. On the web, ARIA Roles in the html help screen readers better understand web page content, along with the many other considerations encouraged by W3C Accessibility standards.\nUniversal access features are features everyone can use. For instance, have you ever watched TV or video with closed captions on? Have you read the transcript of a video or podcast rather than watch or listen because it takes too long? Have you ever chosen to walk up a wheelchair ramp because it allowed you to get around a slow-walking person? These options afford you more choice in how you engage with the designed world.\nDis/ability\nThe word disability has a controversial history. Generally speaking, it is related to people who have impairments, activity limitations, and social participation restrictions. Disability studies is an academic discipline that is concerned with the nature and meaning of disability as a social construction. It can also be referred to medically, or used by the disability community as a means of self-identifying. The Disability Rights Movement focuses on reducing social stigma and ensuring that disabled persons are afforded the same rights and opportunities as any other person. One of the most famous Disability Rights Activists, and the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college, is Helen Keller, born in Alabama on June 27th, 1880. She was an author, lecturer, and a principle fundraiser for The American Foundation for the Blind. More than a century after Keller was born, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted on July 26, 1990. The ADA, in conjunction with other legislation, provides a wide breadth of protections and accommodations for public transportation, housing, communication, and other public services.\nOne way to think of ability is as a fluid state of being. An \"able-bodied\" person can open a door simply by extending their arm and pulling on a handle. A person who requires the use a wheelchair may have a harder time with the same task. However, if you were to give the same able-bodied person a baby to hold and a bag of groceries, opening the door using hands has now become all but impossible—a temporary impairment that has design implications. An affordance that exists for one person does not necessarily exist for another. A potential consequence of labeling someone as disabled is the affliction of learned helplessness, a process by which peers or those with authority convince a person that they are unable to overcome an obstacle, and that trying is pointless.\n\nThe chief handicap of the blind is not blindness, but the attitude of seeing people towards them.\n– Helen Keller\n\nHowever, human beings have potential for incredible accomplishment, regardless of whether they have a disability or not. The Inuit travel enormous distances over seemingly featureless landscapes with advanced navigation techniques that help them find their way; some of the blind have taught themselves echolocation to sense the world, and amputees routinely complete world championship triathlons with the aid of advanced prosthetics, a feat most people who still have all of their limbs accounted for could not accomplish. Continued understanding of natural systems and technological advancements will enable people to do things in a few years that are just not possible to do today. It seems that design and the future of human ability are intrinsically-linked phenomenon.\nEmpathy as a design tool\nThe emergence of empathy strategies for designers has changed the way products and the built environment are created. Achieving empathy means that a designer would approximate the same user experience as one of their users by deliberately simulating physical, cognitive, and environmental constraints. For user-experience designers, there are a variety of digital tools including graphics software that simulates what colors would look like if you were colorblind, javascript libraries that simulate dyslexia, visual overlays that obscure parts of a computer screen to simulate visual impairments, and many others.\n"},"topics/interaction_design.html":{"url":"topics/interaction_design.html","title":"Interaction design","keywords":"","body":"Interaction Design (IxD)\nDesigning for interaction is the process of understanding, accounting for, and sometimes altering a user(s) mental model (what they know and how they think) to facilitate a dialogue between that user and an object, system, or event. In this way, the designer shapes the user. This does not have to be software. You could be designing a conversation between two people by providing discussion topics, a voting ballot to reduce voter confusion and errors, or a new device to make virtual reality feel more like physical reality.\n\n... changes will be realized by designers, and by a specific breed of designers: those creative designers who are both artists and engineers and who are able to balance, over an extended period of time, technology and aesthetics without ever losing sight of the most important facet of design: humanity. [3]\n\nConsumer product design is located in a field called Industrial Design, a term coined in the early 20th century. In the mid-20th century, ergonomics, or the interaction between people and equipment, emerged. After microcomputers were invented, product design began to include software. This shifted design away from ergonomics into interaction design.\nTo design an interaction, a designer must seek to know:\n\nTrue goals of the interaction (this is sometimes different than stated goals)\nUsers' abilities, constraints, and mental models\nWhere and how it will happen\nConstraints of the environment it's happening in\nHow the interaction went\n\nUsers\nImage from The Measure of a Man: Human Factors in Design by Henry Dryfuss\nThe term \"user\" is meant to describe a person who is intended to interact with something that you are designing, be it software or physical object. The idea of \"average users,\" as they are conceptualized by designers, tend to not be very good representations of the real people who use the products. The U.S. Air Force found this out first-hand as they attempted to solve major flight issues in the 1950s. Pilots were having a lot of incidents, sometimes fatal, and they started to wonder if the dimensions of the cockpit, built to the average size of a 1926 male pilot, were no longer working. They took measurements of over 4,000 people with 140 dimensions of measurement.\nLt. Gilbert S. Daniels had studied physical anthropology at Harvard, and was hired to measure the pilots. He garnered skepticism of averages during his undergraduate work, and wondered how many pilots actually fit the average measurements. After crunching the numbers for the 10 most relevant dimensions, he discovered that not a single average airman existed, and using only three of the 10 dimensions, roughly 3.5% matched the average. This discovery upended the assumptions that an average-sized cockpit would fit most pilots. There was no average-sized pilot. This revelation eventually led to the advent of adjustable cockpit seats and pedals, dramatically reducing flight incidents.\nFlow\nThe flow was named by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, a Hungarian psychologist. Flow is a kind of mental state where a person is completely immersed in concentration and focus when performing some action. In interaction design, you typically want your users to be able to access the flow state.\nCsikszentmihalyi's eight characteristics of flow:\n\nCompletely involved in what we are doing—focused, concentrated.\nSense of ecstasy—of being outside everyday reality.\nGreat inner clarity—knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.\nKnowing that the activity is doable—that our skills are adequate to the task.\nA sense of serenity—no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.\nTimelessness—thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by in minutes.\nIntrinsic motivation—whatever produces flow becomes its own reward.\n\nTed: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: Flow, the secret to happiness (18:51)\n\nInteraction Principles\nHuman-computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that emerged in the 1980s, concerned with the engineering and cognitive science implications for human use of technology. Over a decade earlier in 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave a technology presentation which was later referred to as \"The Mother of All Demos.\" In a single presentation, Engelbart showed the computer mouse, word processing, video conferencing, hyper-text and media, addressable objects, collaborative real-time editing, and other aspects of computing that are now ubiquitous. This was a major turning point in computing technology history. Another major turning point was the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh by Apple Computer, Inc., which had the first 2D graphical user interface, otherwise known as a GUI (pronounced gooey).\nThere are five common interaction principles that software developers often refer to when building an interface. They dictate that an interface must be perceivable, predictable, learnable, consistent, and provide feedback to the user. Being perceivable means that a person, who has no prior knowledge, must be able to sense and understand an object or interface. For GUI design, this often means making the interaction possibilities visible in some way. Humans rely on predictions to navigate the world. An unpredictable environment can be frustrating, scary, and in some cases, dangerous. Design language can be used to give users cues and resources for learning. Elements that perform the same action should look and function the same way. This not only refers to visual and physical elements, but also to sound, language, and conceptual organization. Feedback is important in an interface so the user knows that something is happening.\nAffordance theory\nAffordance theory is concerned with the idea that the possibility for action is embedded in objects and shapes. Affordances are the things that can be achieved with the object in question by a particular person. Designers spend a great deal of time perfecting signifiers, so they may communicate what affordances exist very explicitly. For instance a coffee mug with a handle is explicitly telling the user (signifying) that it can be picked up by hand (affordance), and will keep the hand safe from hot temperatures (another affordance). Doors with improperly designed signifiers do not make it clear which way a door should swing.\nRather famously, Don Norman was so put off by bad doors that he wrote the book, \"The Design of Everyday Things.\"\nAn excerpt from The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition, page 11,\n\nThe term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single per- son (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not afford lifting.\n\nFrom Norman's description, we can start to see a strong relationship between semiotics and inclusive design practices.\nCitation\n\nAdapted from: http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/share/ixd/ixd-overview.pdf\nHogue, David M., Interaction Design Fundamentals.

Tharp and Stephanie M. Tharp published a blog post called \"The 4 Fields of Industrial Design: (No, not furniture, trans, consumer electronics, & toys).\" in an attempt to categorize design intentions. [1] As described in a followup post published on Dec. 9, 2015, \"What is Discursive Design?,\" discursive design is described as the practice of designing for the purpose of provoking thought.\n\nThis, of course, demands a purposeful shift—the designed object’s primary role is no longer utilitarian, aesthetic or commercial. Instead it is mostly (though certainly not exclusively) a thought catalyst. The product is given form and function so that it can communicate ideas—this is the goal and the measure of success. Rather than tools for living and doing, these are tools for thinking. [2]\n\nWe find a similar definition from Dunne and Raby's, Design Noir: The Secret Life of Electronic Objects:\n\nCritical design is related to Haute couture, concept cars, design propaganda, and visions of the future, but its purpose is not to present the dreams of industry, attract new business, anticipate new trends or test the market. Its purpose is to stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, industry and the public about the aesthetic quality of our electronically mediated existence.[9]\n\nThe Uncomfortable, a collection of bad product designs created by architect Katerina Kamprani, explores what would happen if the fundamental functional properties of products were altered or thwarted. The resulting collection of objects manages to create objects that are both serious and funny.\n\nMy goal is to deconstruct the invisible design language of simple everyday objects and tweak their fundamental properties in order to surprise you and make you laugh. But also to help you appreciate the complexity and depth of interactions with the simplest of objects around us.\nKaterina Kamprani [10]\n\nSpeculative design\nIf discursive design is \"design as thought catalyst,\" then speculative design is design as possibility catalyst—that is, design for the purpose of imagining new possible futures—enabling ourselves to have real conversations about what kind of world we want to build. In the 1960s, an architecture group, called Superstudio, imagined new kinds of radical architectural design, which helped push design from problem-solving to problem-seeking. This form of design has autonomy from the constraints of the market, and has the benefit of self-reflection.\n\nAnd, whereas traditional design actually legitimizes the status quo, speculative design envisages and anticipates the future, at the same time helping us to understand and re-think the world of today. This approach is most often based on the question “what if?”, examining the interrelation between potential changes in the technological development and social relations. [3]\n\nSteven M. Johnson describes himself as \"an occasional inventor, whimsicalist and possibilitist.\" He publishes illustrations of absurd inventions that are hilarious and thought-provoking commentary while yet somehow retaining plausibility.\nPotential Futures and the Theory of Change\n\nFundamentally, design—the process of bringing into existence the unknown or invisible—envisions the future.\n– Sharon Poggenpohl\n\nBecause speculative design is concerned about the future, it is helpful for us to consider something called the Theory of Change, which can help you map outcomes and causalities. Theory of change is concerned with figuring out what choices can to be made in order to achieve positive future outcomes. Let's consider The \"Three 'Laws' of Futures,\" as outlined by Joseph Voros, that state (1) the future is not  predetermined, (2) the future is not predictable, and (3) future outcomes can be influenced by our choices in the present. Voros' publication, A Primer on Futures Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios is well worth a read-through, and will better describe the logic behind these \"laws.\" Essentially, they point to the idea that each present moment is the culmination of past choices, and therefore, future outcomes can be regarded as something to steward with thoughtful intent.\nThe New York Times article , We Aren't Built to Live in the Moment, argues how the uniquely human skill of thinking about future events is a major driving force behind decisions. From the article:\n\n\"This discovery explains what happens when your mind wanders during a task: It’s simulating future possibilities.\"\n\nThe four classes of potential futures include Probable, Plausible, Possible, and Preferable (referred to as PPPP). In future design, preferable outcomes are located within the realm of probable and plausible. It is most likely not very useful to imagine outside of possible. Possible, in this case, would preclude the idea of something like a square-shaped circle or a magical power—those things are impossible (with our current understanding of the laws of nature) and working such a thing into a work that tries to imagine the future is not very helpful or useful.\n\nBeyond this lies the zone of fantasy, a zone we have very little interest in. Fantasy lives in its own world, with very few links if any to the world we live in. It is of course valuable, especially as a form of entertainment, but for us it is too far removed from how the world is.\" [8]\n\n\nApplying Theory of Change:\n\nTheory of change is a rigorous yet participatory process whereby groups and stakeholders in a planning process articulate their long-term goals and identify the conditions they believe have to unfold for those goals to be met. These conditions are modeled as desired outcomes, arranged graphically in a causal framework. [6]\n\nI've adapted this list from Theory of Change Basics: A Primer on Theory of Change by Taplin and Clark.\n\nIdentify long-term goals and related assumptions.\nMap backwards from long-term goal: Identify preconditions and requirements.\nNote your assumptions of how the system works; articulate your rationale for why outcomes are necessary preconditions to other outcomes.\nDevelop strategic interventions to bring about your desired change.\nDevelop indicators to measure successfulness of outcomes; use them to assess the performance of your initiative.\nQuality review should answer three basic questions: Is your theory 1) plausible, 2) “doable” (or feasible), and 3) testable?\nProduce a narrative to communicate the logic of your initiative.\n\nIf you look carefully at this list, you an also simultaneously locate a place for each step within the Double Diamond design process used throughout this course, further illustrating it's compatibility with other design processes. You can start to see where those steps, particularly in step 6, begin to line up within the PPPP model (described by Voros).\nCitation\n\nhttp://www.core77.com/posts/12232/the-4-fields-of-industrial-design-no-not-furniture-trans-consumer-electronics-toys-by-bruce-m-tharp-and-stephanie-m-tharp-12232.

Much of what we know about visual design was developed and perfected by the masters painters hundreds of years ago. The main goal of visual design is to take command over the viewer's eye, to lead it around a canvas or page for the purpose of communicating some feeling or meaning.\n\nA certain painter, not without some reputation at the present day, once wrote a little book on the art he practises, in which he gave a definition of that art so succinct that I take it as a point of departure for this essay. “The art of painting,” says that eminent authority, “is the art of imitating solid objects upon a flat surface by means of pigments.” It is delightfully simple, but prompts the question—Is that all? And, if so, what a deal of unnecessary fuss has been made about it. [2]\n\nAesthetics\nWhy would someone want to take up their desk space with a small potted plant? Why would a person hang a painting on the wall in their apartment? Why would they buy a red chair? The answer to these questions lies in the emotional consequence of aesthetics. An aesthetic is a set of principles and elements that are used to describe a creative work, locating the intended or emergent language and subjective beauty. Aesthetics can impact a person's mood, comprehension, productivity, behavior, and can result in various forms of bias. The aesthetic-usability effect is a bias where if a design looks easier to use, then it is regarded as such — irrelevant to actual usability characteristics. For these reasons, it is beneficial to always strive for strong aesthetic execution of a creative work. See this Medium.com article for an expanded discussion on aesthetics.\nLanguage of aesthetics\nIn visual design, an aesthetic language is constructed from elements that are organized based upon how humans see with their eyes. Common elements of design include:\n\nLine\nShape\nForm\nSpace\nColor (hue)\nValue (tone)\nTexture\n\nCommon principles of design: [1]\n\nBalance\nDominance, emphasis, and focal point\nMovement\nRepetition, rhythm, pattern\nProportion and scale\nVariety and variation\nUnity/harmony\nContrast\n\nGestalt principles of perception:\nThe following principles describe how the viewer knows that elements are related to each other.\n\nSimilarity\nContinuation\nClosure\nProximity\nFigure-ground\nSymmetry\nCommon fate\nPast experience\n\nIf you have ever taken an art class in a primary or secondary education curriculum, you were most likely taught those principles and elements to make drawings or paintings. The elements may be specific to visual acuity, however, the principles of design aren't restricted image making. They can be used with sound, architecture, fashion, interactive media, experience design, and other types of design.\nThese lists form the basis of a language around talking about design, and help us conduct a process of formal analysis with which we can then break down a work of almost any kind. This language is flexible between media and modes of creative expression. For instance, we can use the term shape to refer to both a geometric or organic visual element. This is its most direct and literal use. We can also use shape to describe the narrative arc of a story, where the shape of the narrative arc tells us about the high and low moments. We can even use shape to describe aspects of how an online course can be taught, indicating moments of passive and active engagement in learning. In this way, shape works as both a visual (physical) and a conceptual (virtual) idea. This ability of this language to slip between physical and virtual references makes it highly useful and adaptable for communicating about design. Creative works can develop their own unique design language, including elements and principles that emerge from the design process or appropriated from other disciplines and fields. It is often the designer's job to define the language that articulates the creative vision.\nIf you'd like to see examples of some of the visual elements put to use, see the Design Aesthetics for the Web course on Lynda.com. They have a slightly different list than the one listed above. I have left type out of my list because I believe that it is more of a semiotic element and I would need to include other \"higher order\" elements into the list–a slippery slope to an unhelpful taxonomy.\nFormal analysis\nOne common way to make a judgement about a creative work is through Formal Analysis. This type of analysis is based entirely on what the viewer sees, and forgoes cultural and historical contexts. Something that is formally ugly can be conceptually beautiful, and something formally beautiful can be vapid and tasteless. The main advantage of formal analysis is that it helps to make feedback understandable by others. There are three steps to conduct a formal analysis:\n\nIdentify and name the formal element\nDescribe how it is being used\nDiscuss the effect it has with respect to the entire work.\n\nExample of formal analysis\n\"The blue area above the figure seems to give me a sense that we are outdoors with a clear sky above. This gives the image a bright and positive feeling.\"\n\nFormal element: blue\nHow it is being used: above the figure \nEffect: ...we are outdoors\n, ...bright and positive feeling\n\nRepresentation technology\nTypography\nTypography is an ancient field that employed typographers who were specialists in the craft of arranging type for the purpose of communicating written language. These specialists invented and understood every facet of working with type and were the only ones capable of producing it–they were both designers and the gatekeepers for what was produced. In contrast, the advent and availability of digital word processing applications have made typography accessible to everyone, and the knowledge of type's design nuances are lost on all but those who work at digital type studios and well-trained graphic designers.\nIn 1439, a German goldsmith named Johannes Gutenberg had struck a business deal with investors to produce and sell small mirrors to Pilgrims at their fair in a nearby town. After discovering he was told the wrong year for the fair, he pitched the idea of the printing press to his business investors. In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg adapted existing screw press technology and metal type. Soon after, mechanized moveable-type became popular and the speed at which knowledge could be spread exploded and by the year 1500, over 20 million books had been printed.\nThe printing press fundamentally changed how knowledge was recorded and disseminated, a disruptive technology that shifted power from the monolithic structure imposed by the Catholic church to individual change-makers spread across the west. Ultimately, this contributed to the de-centralization of power to localized nations, where language, laws, taxes, and cultural identities could develop independently.\nImage\nCapturing accurate visual information as a representational image was a laborious process that required master drawing and painting skills developed over a lifetime of practice–most famously celebrated during the Renaissance period. However, that changed in the 1830s when a French artist and chemist, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, patented the Daguerreotype. A Camera Obscura is an ancient structure or device that allows light in through a small hole, projecting light from the exterior scene onto an interior surface. The Daguerreotype combined the projection ability of the Camera Obscura by exposing chemicals to this light, recording the images onto metal plates.\nGeorge Eastman pioneered film photography technology and began selling it in the late 1800s. The first film camera, called the \"Kodak,\" was offered for sale in 1888. The advent of microprocessors and digital sensors capable of quickly and cheaply recording light information led to the first digital camera in the late 1970s. Now, almost all handheld computing and communication devices like cellphones and tablet computers have hi-resolution cameras embedded.\nIt took John Singer Sargent more than a year to finish the Portrait of Madame X (1884). The computer has enabled the average person with little understanding of chemistry, physics, or painting skills to easily and cheaply capture, edit, duplicate, and disseminate beautiful images to hundreds of people within seconds of the initial impulse.\nCitations\n\nhttp://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf\nRoger Fry, “An Essay in Aesthetics” inVision and Design(orig. publ. 1920; rpt.

People want control over how they are viewed are consciously or unconsciously aligning our own behaviors to conform to a set of norms or ideals—a kind of self design. These norms drive many decisions affecting interest in clothing, sports, food, cars, education, and many other material and non-material aspects of living. Consumer purchases also play a role in helping people express certain aspects of their personality and social status. And it is this idea that personality can be expressed through products that interests the advertisement and marketing industry.\nPersonality\nPsychologists say there are six major traits that differentiate the personality of human minds.\n\nA century of psychology has identified six major dimensions of variation that predict human behavior and that are salient to us. These are the key individual differences that distinguish human minds. These are mental traits that can be measured with good reliability and validity, that are genetically heritable, and stable across the life span, that predict behavior across diverse settings and domains, (school, work, leisure, consumption, and family life), and that seem to be universal across cultures and even across many animal species. [1]\n\nIdentified with the acronym, GOCASE, each letter represents a different trait. G represents general intelligence, O represents openness to experience, C is for conscientiousness and self-control,  A is for agreeableness and kindness, S is for stability in emotion, and E is for extraversion. Conceivably, if you have an ability to understand a person based on those traits, you will have a good idea about how they will behave in different circumstances. Marketers have concerned themselves with selling products to people by appealing to these personality traits.\nPropaganda\n\nThe propagandist must treat personality as he would treat any other objective fact within his province.\n– Edward Bernays [2]\n\nPropaganda is used to sell products just as it is to galvanize mass consensus around political viewpoints, and as Edward Bernays will argue, \"... such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life.\" After World War II, the term took on a more sinister meaning due to the Nazi's considerable and effective use of design and media for propagandistic and tragic ends. Edward Bernays, considered the father of public relations (a term synonymous with advertising and propaganda), authored a book in 1928 aptly named, Propaganda. Bernays, Sigmund Freud's nephew, applied Freudian ideas of unconscious desire for selling  products and manipulation of mass opinion, inventing techniques that are in standard use today by politicians and corporations. In the opening paragraph of Propaganda, Bernays writes, \"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the ruling power of our country.\" Bernays did not believe that a democratic society could be left to run itself without propaganda and that daily life would be otherwise too burdensome. He could not have predicted the impact of technology like the Internet, which provides near instantaneous access to multiple political viewpoints, fact-checking, product reviews, and other information which simultaneously undermines and expands the influence of propaganda on an individual.\nOne effective way that propaganda is designed is through framing. A frame manipulates how a person thinks about something, typically by helping them come to either a negative or positive judgement. This is the primary function of American political commentators, who interpret an event through a frame to support a liberal or conservative rhetoric.\nWhat is identity?\nIdentity is the concept of ourselves, the concept presented to others (your brand), and the concept others have of us. Identity can scale from a single person to an entire nation. Identification is an essential process for human decision making. Differentiating between safe or dangerous is one of the first things humans do unconsciously, and this process is typically based on patterns of the familiar. This plays a core role in identity politics, typically resulting in exclusion or separation of people–and by extension contributes to bigotry and ignorance according to a wide variety of physical or social attributes. What is an identity for a person? Tim Urban explores this question on his blog, Wait But Why, in a post entitled, What Makes You, You? The post is a summary of various models used to understand what identity might be and why it's so hard to pin down.\nBrand identity\nBranding is the narrative that presents the story of a person, company, product, service, or organization to others. Brands are supposed to help people make choices, and reassure them that they made the correct one at a time where products are saturated with competition. Branding is therefore a kind of propaganda for impression management, constructing the identity of a company or person to more easily sell products, ideas, or concepts.\nThe \"tyranny of choice\" is a popular expression that refers to when the overabundance of options paralyzes a person's ability to choose. W. E. Hick published \"On the Rate of Gain of Information\" in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology in 1952, and subsequently Hick's Law was formed. Hick's Law is a mathematical formula used to estimate the amount of time it will take a person to make a decision. It states that the amount of time required to make a decision is a function of the amount of options available. When selling products, branding is used to help a person make those decisions faster. For simple operations, awareness of Hick's Law will help designers better understand how to make an interaction for their users more efficient.\nA good example of the \"tyranny of choice\" can be experienced in the American supermarket. For this example, let's consider which toothbrush to buy, for me a stressful task that never feels gratifying. Some questions I ask while shopping are: which toothbrush has the most effective bristle pattern? Which bristle hardness is the right hardness? Which will cause the least harm to the environment? Which will last the longest before the need to buy another one? Does the value-pack of four toothbrushes make financial sense? Are there reviews that can help me decide? Maybe I should try that sonic thing that shoots sound-waves at my teeth. Why does the eco-friendly bamboo toothbrush cost twice as much though it looks like it will do half as good a job at cleaning? I typically spend 20 minutes in the aisle trying to figure out which option is best option before I give up and purchase the same kind of toothbrush I have been using for the last decade.\nGood branding will communicate the product's attributes and benefits to a person who has corresponding values to hep them choose that product, and will help the consumer feel that they've made the right choice. Buyer's remorse is when someone has regret after buying something, often because they prioritized incorrectly, they didn't spend enough time thinking about their choice, or the product's branding was somehow dishonest.\nIn corporate branding, the market drives brand identity design for the purpose of attracting customers, clients, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders. Branding can help a company to promote a kind of historical heritage, disruptive newness, or another set of values in order to appeal to a target market. Logos, word-marks, letterhead, packaging, architecture, corporate culture, product aesthetics, social impact, and leadership personalities all contribute to the brand identity.\nCitations\n\nMiller, Geoffrey.

Rituals are intended to be specially-designed events that provide opportunities for reflection, celebration, connectivity, behavioral nudging, focus, reinforcement, and more. An example of a small or humble ritual could be a group of friends who have lunch together every week or a busy professional who writes reflective journal entries at the end of the day. Larger, more prestigious rituals include graduation ceremonies, weddings, and organized sporting events like football and baseball. Small rituals tend to not require many resources, are relatively inexpensive, and occur more frequently than larger rituals, some of which may only be experienced once in a lifetime.\nA ritual is an interesting design problem because it is produced for the purpose of disrupting the flow of everyday concerns to bring about new perspective. This is counter to the way we typically think about design – as something that you wouldn't notice if it is done well.\nPhilosopher Alison Gopnik writes that \"passing on rituals seems to be as important in cultural evolution as passing on technologies. In fact, you might argue that rituals are technologies. But they're social technologies instead of physical ones.\"\nIn her book The Gardener and the Carpenter, Gopnik describes how rituals relate to identity:\n\"Human beings engage in rituals, from Sunday morning football to afternoon tea service to midnight mass. Rituals are actions that make little sense by themselves but serve important social functions. By performing very specific actions in a highly prescribed way, you can identify who you are or what group you belong to.\nIn fact, you can actually become a different kind of person by engaging in the right ritual. I became a wife by doing a bunch of elaborate things with rings and wearing a funny dress; I became a Ph.D. by walking slowly down a long aisle in an impressive Christoper Wren building in Oxford and being tapped on the head by a man in a funny dress. (Funny dresses seem to play and especially important role in rituals.)\nThe whole point of rituals is that they don't make ordinary casual sense. They are potent precisely because they're divorced from ordinary principles of efficiency... (I once made the grave mistake of attending a Japanese tea ceremony when I was thirsty and wanted tea—the ritualized beauty of the proceedings is much easier to appreciate when you're not counting on a useful causal outcome.)\"\nDesigning a ritual\nThis project asks you to go through a variety of design phases. The first discovery phase asks you to conduct and interview. From there, you will pull out themes, develop a \"How might we\" question, develop ideas as a group, create and test prototypes, and produce a final fully interactive app proposal. Solutions to this project brief should not be literal solutions for solving your interviewees problems, but rather experimental rituals that ask or nudge people to change their behavior in some way, and creatively explore the themes identified in the interview.\nWhat not to do\nWhen you go through the research process, it may be tempting to design for a direct, literal problem. For instance, you may hear from your interviewee that they have trouble dealing with time management or remembering to get certain tasks done. Your first instinct would be to solve this issue by designing a todo list or calendar tool. However, a quick Internet search will reveal many todo and calendar tools, and unless you are planning a radical shift in how those particular tools function, it makes sense to approach the problem from a different perspective. By trying to gain insight into the behavior of your interview subject, you can come up with novel ritual ideas that seek to create new types of behavior.\nYour project must contain elements of novelty and does NOT need to solve a literal problem. Please avoid calendar and todo list design solutions for this project.\nInspiration\n\nSomebody App\nRitual Design Lab\nSee Wade Davis TED Talk on ritual and what makes us human.

By creating unexpected and surreal social experiences (watch the video) and complicating our normally instant communication with \"missions,\" uncertainty, and a fun blobby user interface, the app designed a magical real world experience facilitated by an app.\n\nWhile this project focuses on designing an experience, you will be creating a basic user interface, so it will be helpful to look at real world interfaces for inspiration. The apps and websites you visit everyday are full of visual designs and conventions that you can borrow from, but one important designer to look at is Susan Kare, creator of early icons for the Mac operating system. This article about Susan Kare's early work at Apple, reveals some of her inspiration and sketches for the early icons. Her focus on creating a \"friendly and humane\" experience is a reminder that technology can support our natural emotions and experiences rather than dominate them. \n\nMargaret Hagen asks Can we design rituals to improve orgs’ culture? in this great article on Medium. She gives props to employees and asks them to design a ritual in five minutes, resulting in \"rubber duck head-drops, the knighting of each other with thick black glasses, bear-paw growls, and pinecone tosses.\" Hagen helpfully defines rituals as the \"magic and meaning of special actions,\" which should remind you that rituals are supposed to be different from normal behavior and can be very strange indeed!\nFinally, Kursat Ozenc writes about The 3 most unconventional designers of 21st century — starting with Design shaman.

Set up an interview. It can be a family member, a friend, a colleague at work, a student, etc. Ensure that you have at least an hour of time. The interview can be in-person, over the phone, or via video conversation. Please do not send a list of questions to your interviewee, as you will need to tailor the interview questions during the conversation. If you intend to record the interview (not required) you must obtain the permission of the interviewee.\nStep 2: Find challenges\nStart the interview by asking your participant about their daily routine. Try to find something they do or experience every day that they find distracting, challenging, frustrating, or something they wish they didn't have to do.\nInterview Tip: Try to have a natural conversation. Laugh, joke, and don't rely solely on the example questions below. Give your subject plenty of time to respond, awkward pauses may result in valuable responses if you're patient. \nExample questions\nDaily challenges:\n\nTell me about your day today or a typical day in your life.\nDo you find anything particularly challenging about your daily routine?\nDo you have any reoccurring frustrations?  \n\n\nIf you could change something about your typical day, what would it be?\nIs there something that, if only you were incredibly good at it, you could improve some aspect of your life?\nWhy aren't you good at it? (\"it\" should be a specific thing, see Laddering - Five 'Why?'s)\n\n\n\nLife-long challenges:\n\nWhat is a long-term challenge or frustration in your career or life?\nWhy is it challenging? (\"it\" should be a specific thing, see Laddering - Five 'Why?'s)\n\n\nIf you could go back to childhood and begin your life again, what would you want to do as an adult?\nWhy did you choose this answer?\n\n\nIs there anything preventing you from doing this now? If so, what are some of those things?\nWhy do you think that is? (\"it\" should be a specific thing, see Laddering - Five 'Why?'s)\n\n\n\nCore Values\n\nWhat do you value more, adventure or stability?\nWhy do you think that is? (\"it\" should be a specific thing, see Laddering - Five 'Why?'s)\n\n\nWhat is a place that has special meaning to you? (At home, or elsewhere)\nWhat details can you recall most clearly? Describe them.\n\n\nWhat is a group, culture, or \"tribe\" that you strongly identify with?\nHow do your participate in, or show your connection to, that group?\n\n\n\nOriginal Questions\nPrepare three or more original questions that you will ask your subject.\n\n_______________________________?\n_______________________________?\n_______________________________?\n\nLaddering - Five 'Why?'s\nLaddering is a technique developed in the 1960s to help clinical psychologists uncover core values and beliefs. If your participant has many responses from the previous step, focus on one response. Ask your participant why. Asking why helps us to better understand an ambiguous issue and gets to a more emotional aspect of a problem. After they respond, ask why again. Repeat this until you have asked why five times. Asking five times is important because core issues will start to emerge around four or five levels deep. Ask about their responses specifically to avoid horizontal questions. For example, \"Why else didn't you get your homework done?\" is a horizontal question. \"Why didn't you have enough time to complete the assignment?\" is a deeper question.\nStep 3: Recording responses\n\nRecord the interviewee's responses in your journal. You don't need to write everything they say. Try to capture the key insights. \nMake a note of any responses that led to a deeper understanding of what motivates this person?\nThe interview is about better understanding a potential user's problems.

Did any strike you as interesting, silly, novel, or brilliant? Brainstorming sessions don't always lead to useful or good ideas, so it's important to be realistic about their utility in your design process. For this assignment, you will develop and map out key aspects of a creative ritual as a storyboard. \nThe storyboard is a sequence of drawings or images that communicate what the ritual is and how it will occur. This will give others the opportunity to provide feedback, and forces the designer to think about all of the key decisions in more detail. This storyboard should be fairly abstract, and does not need to reference the app at all.\nIMPORTANT: The storyboard should show a person performing the ritual. It should not show any screen-based content. \nReview the Introduction page for this project, and recall that while you are trying to help your subject, the point is not to optimize efficiency but to create a meaningful ritual. Do not make a traditional to-do list or calendar app. \nA good ritual is:\n\nSymbolic.\nSeparate from everyday routine.\nMade of highly prescribed actions (e.g. tea ceremony).\nSpecial (e.g. dressed up, weird, silly, magical, or important).\n\nMaterials\n\nPen and/or pencil\nJournal\nCamera or scanner\nPrinter\nRitual Storyboard Template\n\nDesigning the ritual\nThere are many descriptions available of what a ritual is and how it functions. We will consider four key aspects as core design components for the ritual.\n\nScript: The script describes the triggers and the associated events.\nFrame: The frame is the mental model that suggests what the ritual's purpose is, and what the intended outcome is. Instead of writing, \"I play board games with my family on Sunday,\" you would add context for why the ritual is important and instead write, \"Family Board Game Day transforms Sunday afternoons into time for positive interactions with my family.\"\nTrigger: A trigger could be a time of day, the onset of a certain feeling, or some other moment that initiates the ritual, and the ritual's related events. For example, \"It's Sunday afternoon\" is a trigger to start the ritual. \"Sunday afternoon is over,\" indicates that it's time to stop the ritual.\nEvent: An event is any action or performance that occurs in the ritual. Indication to start an event comes from a trigger or script. Example events include, \"Gather in the game room,\"  and \"choose which board game to play.\"\n\nInstructions\n\nDownload: Ritual Storyboard Template \nWrite the frame and list all of the triggers, events, and scripts that comprise the ritual on the storyboard. \nNumber the sequence to indicate the flow of the storyboard (e.g. #1, #2, etc.)\nYou can print the Ritual Storyboard PDF or use a markup tool to write directly on the digital file.\n\n\nThere must be a minimum of one fill sheet (8 boards) describing the ritual.\n\n\nPost work to the Studio\nUse the file format indicated in each step.

The ritual can involve physical actions that take place outside of the app, in the real world, with other people, or in the user's mind. \nWireframes are informal sketches that help designers test their ideas so they can quickly iterate the design and gather feedback. This process is important because it helps product designers make decisions before wasting resources on a final product that solves the wrong problem.

These stories affect our attitudes, beliefs, and form our entire perception of reality. Historically, stories are how humans have transferred knowledge from generation to generation. Everything a designer does will be in support of telling stories and by extension, shape the world we inhabit.\n\nStorytelling has a long history as a mechanism of knowledge transfer and can be considered a rapid immersion in an experience: One cannot experience time travel, but one can gain knowledge about the act of time travel through a rich compelling, and highly experiential story.  \n  – Jon Kolko\n\nLesson Objective\nThe goal of this lesson is not to teach you every facet and application of storytelling. Mastering this subject, as with most subjects, will take quite a long time.

Storytelling is one way humans are able to perceive reality and make sense of the events unfolding around them. Reality is essentially organized by the storytellers of the world.\nMeaning, however, cannot be created and widely distributed to people without going through some sort of cognitive filter. Most people are predisposed to favor information that supports their existing beliefs, and less likely to consider information counter to their existing beliefs, a condition called confirmation bias. This bias hampers reason-based decision-making and prevents a person from considering and using new ideas that are counter to the ones they already believe. Compelling arguments are needed for overcoming these types of biases, no matter what kind of story is being told.\nA poorly delivered story presents us with what we can think of as a bad argument – that is that this story is not reasonable, we don't care about it, and it doesn't appeal to our sense of identity. Skepticism of new ideas can be assuaged with the persuasive argument's appeal to logic (logos), emotions (pathos), and ethics (ethos). What is reasonable, emotionally moving, and indicative of a someone's sensibilities is often specific to one point in history; from one culture to another; and from one person to another. For many, however, the appeal to emotion seems to be the driving force of an effective story, often moving viewers past logical or ethical shortcomings that may be present.\nGreat storytellers can have great impact. Storytelling does more than just help people understand the world. It motivates great action to be taken, moving an imagined dream into being. In this way, people who create and disseminate stories have a tremendous amount of power to shape the world. With this power comes an implicit contract with your audience – that what they are experiencing is authentic in a manner that allows them to understand a deeper truth.\nA person can now read, watch, interact with, or listen to a new story every day for the rest of their life. Social media technology gives marketers the power to directly market stories according to a person's existing beliefs and interests, thereby surrounding a person in only the stories that support the reality they have already bought into. What effects might this have on a given society's ability to organize and govern when its inhabitants have found different interpretations of reality to be the \"truth\"?\nStory and object\nSemiotics, the study of signs and symbols, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Ferdinand de Saussure's dyadic model consists of the signifier and the signified, and the Charles Sanders Peirce triadic model consists of icons, indices, and symbols. Just like Forrest Gump's shoes, objects are \"sign vehicles,\" targets of mental acts but these objects do not have to be physical things. From the perspective of storytelling, objects are the medium by which a story is told. The authors of the book, The Axemaker's Gift, remind us that humans figured out how to do this with writing approximately 12,000 years ago.\n\n\"The first examples of writing occurred in the Near East at the time when animals and plants were being domesticated. They took the form of clay tokens, smaller than an inch in size, used to represent different commodities.\" [1]\n\nThe significance of this event is that people could now ascribe meaning (in this case to count grain and livestock for trade) using abstract markings on clay tokens. The token was a standardized signifier, which made commerce possible in prehistoric times. Eventually, the desire to describe other types of information led to the development of a written language and number systems. Out of that arose complex social structures, division of labor, law, cities, property ownership, and other aspects of modern civilization.\nStories, media, and society\nBecause story is ubiquitous to the human experience, you find it embedded in almost every human endeavor where communication of some kind is involved. Creative products like films, novels, drawings, paintings, comic books, and games tell stories to highlight moral quandaries, to contribute to discourse on a popular or marginalized subject, to function a teaching tool, to entertain, to enlighten, and to otherwise encapsulate cultural expression. Architecture uses form and dimension of space and structure to tell the story of how people should use space, to signal the culture of a place, and to describe other aspects of sheltered human interaction.\nIn product and service design, graphic designers use visual design elements to communicate simple ideas like how to use a voting ballot or abstract ideas like company brand identities. Industrial designers use visual and sculptural elements to communicate what a product does and how it should be used. Story can help businesses empathize with customers to create better products and services, recognize new ways of approaching solutions, and help customers choose between similar products.\nJournalists working for televised news stations, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other publications combine photography, video, and investigative reporting techniques to communicate information about events. War of the Worlds, a fiction written by H. G. Wells and adapted by Orson Welles to simulate a live news broadcast, was read on the live radio on Halloween in 1938, causing some listeners to panic, believing that there was a real alien invasion occurring. Similar in format to radio shows, podcast shows now combine journalism techniques, creative writing, and sound editing to tell compelling audio stories.\nPoliticians use stories to gain public support for proposed policies and actions whereas activists use coordinated gatherings with signage, music, song, dance, and other types of performance to communicate their stories to the general public. Social change agents use stories to create empathy through all forms of media, helping bring attention to marginalized members of society.\nCitations\n\nBurke, James, and Robert Evan Ornstein.

A story (sequence of events) is expressed through narration, or the recounting of events. A narrative is a method of telling a story and is tangible. We know that a narrative is tangible because we can perceive the telling of stories through written text, sound, performance, image, etc. A narrative account of a split-second could last for the entire retelling whereas an event that lasted 100 years could be retold in a few seconds. Narrative places emphasis, focus, and perspective for stories. A plot is the connective tissue between story events, describing the causal relationships and context for viewers.\n\nStory: A sequence of events. Can occur spatially or temporally.\nPlot: Creates meaning by connecting story events with context.\nNarrative: Method of telling story.\n\nWatch Kurt Vonnegut's humorous lecture on storytelling. Shapes of Stories (4:36)\nExample Story:\nBelow, I have written a story (based on real events). I then described the plot of the story, and used written narrative to tell a single moment in the story from a third person Point of View.\nStory\n(1) A new family sets off on a routine, but potentially dangerous voyage. (2) Their baby gets sick (3) Their vessel takes on water. (4) They call for help. (5) They get rescued and face public scrutiny\nPlot\nSimon and Mary, along with their newborn child, plan to cross the Pacific Ocean in their sailboat–a journey they have done many times. They take all necessary precautions before the trip. Despite being cleared for travel, their baby gets a fever. There is a harsh storm that damages their sailboat and it began taking on water. With a damaged boat, a sick child, and no means of communication, they turn on a rescue beacon. The rescue team arrives in helicopter and they abandon their sailboat. They must then defend themselves from public scrutiny related to child endangerment and the high cost of a rescue at sea.\nWritten story narrative\n\"The waves have been crashing against the hull for hours. This has to be the worst storm we've ever sailed through,\" Simon thought to himself. To his horror, sea water begin to pour in through a crack at the base of the mast. He pulled the bright orange emergency beacon out of its case and looked at it. He looked over at Mary, who was sitting at the back of the cabin, cradling their infant. \"If we turn the beacon on, it's all over,\" he yelled. She nodded, confirming the heavy weight of the decision. After all, it wasn't just a boat, it was also their home and they were about to abandon it. Forever.\nNarrative structure\nA narrative structure orders or disorders the events of a story for the audience, and combines those events with plot. A linear narrative is chronological, whereas a non-linear narrative is non-chronological. There are commonly used frameworks for storytelling which started with Aristotle's three-part structure consisting of a beginning, middle, and end. From there, structures become more nuanced and descriptive.\nStories are big business. Hollywood films tend to have structural models that traditionally sell well in the box office, increasing the probability that they will see a return on the production investment. The perception is that experimental or uncommon narrative structures tend to be risky. The same can be said for large game developers who are inclined to produce sequels of top-selling titles.\nThis can explain why many of the boundary-pushing films tend to come from independent authors and screenwriters, indie game developers, and indie filmmakers. They have less of a financial stake in the outcomes of sales, and are more likely to focus on new modes of expression, craft, and originality of content.\nDramatic structure\nGustav Freytag (1816 - 1895), a German dramatist and novelist, developed a structure for the way stories are told in ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama. This analysis is known as Freytag's analysis, dramatic structure, or Freytag's Pyramid. His analysis consisted of the following five acts:\n\nexposition\nrising action\nclimax\nfalling action\ndénouement/resolution\n\nThis five-act structure works well when describing Greek and Shakespearean plays. However, there are many ways to analyze the structure of a narrative. Most contemporary stories can be described with according to common structural breakdowns – the Three Act, Four Act, Five Act, Seven Act, and Hero's Journey. These structures can help us understand how a story is told, and act as a heuristic for writing your own story.\nThree Act\n\nBeginning\nMiddle\nEnd\n\nThree Act Plot Diagram\nThe following Plot Diagram shows the Five Act plot points laid over a Three Act structure.\n\nFour Act\n\nInciting incident\nFirst Act Turn to Second Act Turn\nSecond Act Turn to Third Act Turn\nThird Act Turn to Resolution\n\nFive Act\n\nExposition\nRising action\nClimax\nFalling action\nResolution\n\nSeven Act\n\nBackstory\nCatalyst\nBig event\nMidpoint\nCrisis\nClimax\nRealization\n\nHero's Journey\n\nThe ordinary world\nCall to adventure\nRefusal of the call\nMeeting with the mentor\nCrossing the threshold\nTests, allies, and enemies\nApproach\nThe ordeal\nThe reward\nThe road back\nThe resurrection\nReturn with the elixir\n\nNon-linear narrative structures\nA non-linear structure is not necessarily chronological or cause-and-effect based. Story is unfolded simultaneously and recursively. Non-linear narratives are often used to create links between things that are otherwise not connected to create meaning or tension, a device used commonly in surrealism.\nInteractive narrative\nThe story you experience in an interactive narrative work is not predetermined. The story path is chosen based on a viewer's choices. In video games, the number of story events that can be chosen through interaction can be quite high, making subsequent play-throughs unique. Newer games rely on generative algorithms and artificial intelligence to create the environment around these choices.\nDecision nodes\nAn interactive narrative is comprised of decision or action points called nodes, where the user impacts the unfolding of the narrative by making a choice or performing an action. The choice the user makes can determine which branching narrative path is taken. The decisions themselves are part of the plot, which handles dramatization of the events.\n\nFor example, let's say you are playing a hypertext narrative, and your character is a young woman who sees a hooded figure shoplifting. The options to proceed include a) tell the shopkeeper, b) follow the shoplifter, or c) do nothing. Depending on which choice you select, the story will progress through on one of three branching paths.\nCritical story path\nA critical story path can be thought of as the shortest path possible through a series of decision nodes to complete the interactive story.\nTo develop the critical path:\n\nAll the critical story beats must be accounted for\nDetermine essential actions and decisions\nIdentify the optional narrative interactions that build around the central story\n\nLinear narrative structural models\nBranching\nThe branching structure is the structure used in \"choose your own adventure\" books and most interactive narratives. One problem with branching structures is the tendency to create overly complicated story paths.\n\nString of pearls\nIn this linear structure, a user must complete node's requirements to continue to the next node.\n\nHero's journey\nIn this linear structure, a user would follow the 12 stages of the hero's journey. However, there can be fewer or additional stages and still be considered a journey structure. Some stories continue around this path, creating a continuous.\nParallel worlds\n\nIn this quasi-linear structure, users are given the opportunity to explore multiple storylines running in parallel. There is typically no way to experience all of the stories at once, though they may intersect at opportune times.\nDrill-down\n\nThe drill-down is a bi-linear structure and encourages users to move through a story vertically and laterally, where lateral movement represents plot points and vertical movement represents the gathering additional details about the plot.\nNon-linear structural models\nSandbox or open-world\n\nA sandbox structure is one where the story unfolds based on how a player chooses to interact in what is typically a large, open environment. This is a loose structure where the setting of the story often becomes central to the experience.\nGraph\nA graph structure is where all nodes simultaneously connect with every other node bi-bidirectionally. Discerning a plot causality in such a structure can be difficult.\nCreating your own structural model\nQuite often, no perfect model exists for the kind of story that needs to be told. Part of the creative process for writing a narrative is producing the model that can best support the story.\nCitation\n\nDigital Storytelling: A Creator's Guide to Interactive Entertainment.

It is also a technical process, where common elements are added, subtracted, combined, and transformed to convey meaning, encourage insights, and intensify excitement or tension.\nShow, don't tell.\nWhen drafting a story, it is often best to convey information and ideas indirectly. For instance, you could write, \"Xavier was a very nice person.\" Alternatively, you could write, \"Xavier spent his weekends volunteering at a local shelter and working part time as a nurse.\" Both methods communicate the kind of person Xavier is, but the latter is typically more engaging for the reader.\nYou can extrapolate this concept to practically everything you make.

I hate it when you do that!\" yelled Linda.\nThis dialogue is an example of direct conversation,  where we are shown that Linda is upset because Bob is doing something that she disapproves of. Alternatively, the audience can be told the same information like this:\n\"Linda yelled at Bob in a loud voice. She wanted him to stop and told Bob that she didn't approve of what he was doing.\"\nArguably, the direct conversation method is more engaging and can let us see the personality and emotion of the characters.\nAudience\nThe audience is who are you writing the story for, and the way you put together the story elements should have your audience in mind. Story genre fan bases are essentially consumer markets. When a storyteller is complicit with fan service (fulfills the expectations of fans), it means they are catering to a market that buys a particular kind of story, which tend to be valued more by publishers as products rather than creative and expressive works. This exists heavily in literature, film, cartoons, video games, and other forms of media.\nStory Elements\nSetting/environment\nThe setting is the environment in which the story takes place. The setting helps establish the tone, story genre, and often foreshadows future events in the plot. In some video games, the environment is also a narrative device, providing context for the world the characters inhabit.\nPoint of View (PoV)\nWho is telling the story? Who are you experiencing the story through? Depending on the point of view, the author can create a sense of intimacy with the story, or a more objective and distant perspective.\n\nFirst person: (I, we)\nSecond person: (you)\nThird person: (he, she, they)\n\nCharacter\n\nAssign characterization types to characters\nDevelop character profiles\nIdentify tropes to apply to characters or change characters to avoid unwanted tropes\n\nPlot\n\nWrite critical beats (decision points)\nSupports critical story path\nInclude elements:\nThe way it was\nAnd then one day...\nRaising the stakes\nMoment of change\nWorld as it is now\n\n\n\n\nWrite optional beats.\nThese become possible branches in your narrative.\n\n\n\nStructure\n\nChoose or design a structural model for the narrative.\nThe narrative structure should support critical story path and desired supplemental story interaction\nIf developing an interactive story, the structure might be on a dynamic scale between linear and non-linear. In games, cut scenes tend to be linear while gameplay and interaction tends to be non-linear.\n\n\n\n"},"topics/character.html":{"url":"topics/character.html","title":"Character","keywords":"","body":"Character\nIn fictional film or literature, character types are used to help viewers to empathize with the story. A person's character typically refers to the qualities they possess. However, a character can also be an animal, object, or abstraction in a story. Objects are often represented through anthropomorphism, where human attributes are applied to a non-human. According to an explainer video about animated light for the movie, Akira, the city itself was considered to be a character. Other examples of non-human characters include Lightning McQueen from Cars (2006) and a homicidal car tire named Robert in the movie Rubber (2010).\nCharacterization\nIn the process of characterization, a writer will construct traits of a character according to how they will serve the story's plot requirements. Characters are often inspired by people from real life, but often become simplified, combined, and adapted as needed.\nSee tvtropes.org wiki for an expansive collection of characterization tropes.\nTypes (tropes) in fictional stories\nCharacter types are often one or a combination of the following:\n\nMain character: We experience the story through this character's eyes.\nSupporting character: These characters help us understand the main character, advance the story.\nProtagonist character: The story typically follows this character most closely. They are needed to resolve the conflict and typically have heroic qualities.\nAntagonist character: Tries to prevent the story goal. Opposes the protagonist.\nDynamic character: Shows development and change over time.\nStatic character: Does not develop or change over time.\nAnti-hero character: Protagonist who lacks heroic qualities.\nRound character: Well developed, complex, sometimes contradictory traits.\nFlat character: Not well developed, static.\nStock character: Archetypal, stereotypical, and flat.\nFoil character: Typically contrasts the main character in qualities and values so that we may learn more about the main character.\nSymbolic character: This character represents an abstract concept like \"hope\" or \"justice.\"\n\nCharacter profiling\nCreating a character profile is helpful to describe the way in which a character connects with and supports the telling of a story.\n\nImportance to story\nWhat role does the character play?\nCharacterization types\n\n\nPhysical attributes\nName, age, gender\nMarkings, tattoos\nAbilities, disabilities\nRace/ethnicity\n\n\nInner struggle and journey\nWhat motivates the character?\nWhat does the character want more than anything?\nWhat do they fear most?\nHow do they hide their true selves from the world?\nWhat would they want to be remembered for?\nWhat do they learn by the end of the story?\n\n\nPersonality\nUnique trait\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nCritical flaw that impacts the story\nBehaviors and actions\nBack story that explains why they are this way\n\n\nStory interaction\nInternal conflicts\nExternal conflicts\nMeetings with other characters\nHow are character flaws introduced into the story?\n\n\n\n"},"topics/narrative-media.html":{"url":"topics/narrative-media.html","title":"Narrative media","keywords":"","body":"\nNarrative media\nA medium is a carrier or vehicle of stuff, and in the case of creative work, concepts, ideas, and other expressions. If you are standing next to a person, and would like to communicate something you are thinking to them, you would simply use verbal communication, assuming you both spoke the same language. For a very long time, this was the main way humans communicated. Over time, people discovered that they could convey ideas without having to be physically present for the communication to take place. Written language allowed people to communicate an idea repeatedly, to different people, without having to be there.\nFast forward to now, digital formats now afford people communicate across the planet by talking into a box that fits into the palm of your hand. Some are working on brain interfaces so that communication of thoughts can happen automatically and without the possible constraints imposed by spoken and written language.\nTransmedia\nTransmedia is communication of ideas and experiences through multiple mediums. But what exactly is a medium?\nA medium is a carrier or vehicle of stuff, and in the case of creative work, concepts, ideas, and other expressions. If you are standing next to a person, and would like to communicate something you are thinking to them, you would simply use verbal communication, assuming you both spoke the same language. For a very long time, this was the main way humans communicated. Over time, people discovered that they could convey ideas without having to be physically present for the communication to take place. Written language allowed people to communicate an idea repeatedly, to different people, without having to be there.\nFast forward to now, we can use different media simultaneously to communicate. When one thing is being communicated across media, this is called Transmedia. Typically, each medium used adds to, expands, contextualizes content in different ways in a non-linear fashion.\nUnlike single-source media, transmedia refers to the idea that a narrative is communicated and experienced across multiple forms of media. A good example of a transmedia narrative project is documented in the film, The Institute (2013). In the film, fictional and non-fiction stories unfold through a wide array of media including paper fliers, physical installations and puzzles, radio programs, organized events, video recordings, phone calls, and others.\nInteractive media\nInteractive media is communication that you can influence or control in some way. In some cases, the viewer becomes the co-author of the communication by adding their own content. One of the most notable examples of interactive fiction is video games. Most, but not all, video games follow linear stories where players perform actions to move the story forward.\nExamples\n\nhttp://playspent.org/\n\nHypertext\nAn early computing pioneer, Theodor H. Nelson, summed up hypertext as this:“ by hypertext, I mean non-sequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at an interactive screen. As popularly conceived, this is a series of text chunks connected by links, which offer the reader different pathways.”\nCERN officially put the World Wide Web (WWW), developed by British Scientist Tim Berners-Lee, into the public domain on 30 April, 1993. The WWW, or simply \"Web,\" allows for the use of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to quickly and reliably retrieve and distribute information between a Web Browser and a Web Server.\nNot long after, people started using hypertext as a means to tell both linear and non-linear stories, called hypertext narratives. Before the introduction of the Web, hypertext fictions were first published using desktop software such as Storyspace and Hypercard. Afternoon, written by Michael Joyce in 1987 and published by Eastgate Systems in 1991, is considered one of the first hypertext fictions. Hypertext fiction confronts readers with nodes of text; decision points where they use hypertext links to navigate to other nodes. Because the order in which the story is revealed will depend on reader choices, reader becomes–in a sense–co-author. The concept of linked nodes of content has extended past text-based media to multimedia objects called hypermedia.\n"},"reading-reflections/chapter_8_giorgio_vasari_and_the_permutations_of_design.html":{"url":"reading-reflections/chapter_8_giorgio_vasari_and_the_permutations_of_design.html","title":"Chapter 8.

Black Panther (2018) was a groundbreaking film for many reasons, one of which was its portrayal of an afrofuturist society in mainstream pop culture. Afrofuturism is a genre of literature, philosophy, art, and design, that extrapolates African cultures into the future, upending the typically Eurocentric vision of the future. This article is a good roundup of Afrofuturist architecture and design products, but it's worth reading this CityLab interview with Black Panther production designer Hannah Beachler.\nBeachler and her colleagues designed the entire capital city of Wakanda for Black Panther including a 500 page \"Wakanda bible\" that detailed the nation's history and technology. In the interview, she describes how \"she emphasized human connection in her design\" by focusing on public transit instead of cars and putting cultural identity on display.\nWhat other cultures or locations can you bring thirty years into the future?

Though out of print at the time of this writing, the entire book can be read for free at opendesignnow.org. Open design is not necessarily opposed to capitalism or the free market, though open design projects, viewpoints, and experiments often present ideas that suggest alternative ways of supporting such systems and processes in a more fair, effective, inclusive, and sustainable way. To be sure, open design tends to emphasize shifting knowledge and power structures from an elite few to the many. Distinct features of open design include a variety of attributes that are counter to how design traditionally occurs, particularly for the purpose of supporting market and business goals. Many of the projects enthusiastically discussed in Open Design Now! are defunct, a telling indicator of open design's relationship to the many forces and systems in play — can open design survive?\nNotable projects that still exist include Open Structures, Wiki House, Local Motors and Open Source Ecology, all of which hope to use the power of open source technology with crowdsource design communities to enable the average person to create houses, products, vehicles, and sustainable living environments.\nOpen design is made available, sharable, and licensed under open access terms. For access to be open, it cannot be concealed, protected, or licensed under a fee or payment structure. For instance, Apple, Inc. is highly secretive about their projects until they are released to the public. The Linux operating system project is a good example of a transparent-box design, where development and functionality is exposed. Open design helps others contribute by using common digital notation language to specify blueprints and plans. The use of proprietary notation language for specification does not contribute to openness. An example of an open specification language can be found at Schema.org, where a community of developers promote structured data for the Internet. Open design is reconfigurable and extendable enabling derivatives, whereas design that is not open is black-boxed or fixed, preventing derivatives from being possible. Open design is reproducible and not exclusive or limited to a finite series. In contrast, one-offs are not compatible with the open design philosophies. Open design can be fabricated by commercial, off-the-shelf, multi-purpose machines expanding a means of production to more people. If the design must be fabricated by a skilled artisan or if it requires custom built machines or moulds, then it is not open. The manufacturing process of open design is subject to distributed and scalable production. A centrally controlled and preset batch production process is not open design. Open design has generative qualities whereas closed design does not have this potential, and is close-ended. [1]\nDIY\nMake magazine launched in 2005 by Dale Dougherty, and challenged users to move from passive participants into active product production roles. Not only would users make their own products, but they would gain in-depth understanding of how production technology works. Make: published the The Maker's Bill of Rights to their website in 2006, which includes lines like, \"If it snaps shut, it shall snap open.\" and \"Special tools are allowed only for darn good reasons.\"\nOpen source\nOpen source consists of projects open to modification by an engaged community of developers. This text is written and published on an open source tool called Gitbook, which itself only exists because of a multitude of other open source software projects. This text is open source as well, and modifications can be made and suggested by anyone with a computer and Internet access.\nOpen innovation\nOpen innovation refers to organizations that demonstrate a large amount of transparency and discourse in their design process. One notable organization is Mozilla, chronicling their open branding initiative and requesting advice and guidance from the greater design community.

He calls upon open designers to take this responsibility seriously.\nJohn Thackara\nIn 1909, Peter Kropotkin was asked whether it was possible to learn a trade as difficult as gardening from books. “Yes, it is possible,” he replied, “but a necessary condition of success, in work on the land, is communicativeness – continual friendly intercourse with your neighbours.”\nAlthough a book can offer good general advice, Kropotkin explained, every acre of land is unique. Each plot is shaped by the soil, its topography and biodiversity, the wind and water systems of the locality, and so on. “Growing in these unique circumstances can only be learned by local residents over many seasons,” the aristocratic anarchist concluded. “The knowledge which has developed in a given locality, that is necessary for survival, is the result of collective experience.”[1]\nThe biosphere, our only home, is itself a kind of garden – and we have not looked after it well. On the contrary, we have damaged many of the food and water systems that keep us alive, and wasted vast amounts of non-renewable resources. TREND: SCARCITY OF RESOURCES One of the main reasons we’ve damaged our own life-support system is that we under-value the kinds of socially created knowledge Kropotkin wrote about. Ongoing attempts to privatize nature, and the over-specialization of knowledge in our universities, continue to render us blind to the consequences of our own actions.\nOpenness, in short, is more than a commercial and cultural issue. It’s a matter of survival. Systemic challenges such as climate change, or resource depletion – these ‘problems of moral bankruptcy’ – cannot be solved using the same techniques that caused them in the first place. Open research, open governance and open design are preconditions for the continuous, collaborative, social mode of enquiry and action that are needed.\nFor centuries, the pursuit of knowledge KNOWLEDGE was undertaken in open and collaborative processes. Science, for example, developed as a result of peer review in an open and connected global community. Software, too, has flourished as a result of social creativity in what Yochai Benckler has named ‘commons-based peer production’.[2] These approaches stand in stark contrast to the legacy left by the industrial economy – from cars to power stations – which depends on a command-and-control business model and militant copyright protection. The internet may have made it easier, technically, to share ideas and knowledge – but an immense global army of rights owners and attendant lawyers works tirelessly to protect this closed system of production.\n\nOPENNESS, IN SHORT, IS MORE THAN A COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL ISSUE. IT’S A MATTER OF SURVIVAL.\n\nThe open design experiments you will read about in this book – such as the 60 Fab Labs in operation as we go to press – are nodes within an alternative industrial system that is now emerging. These are the “small, open, local and connected” experiments that environmental designer Ezio Manzini views as defining features of a sustainable economy.[3]\nOpen design is more than just a new way to create products. As a process, and as a culture, open design also changes relationships among the people who make, use and look after things. Unlike proprietary or branded products, open solutions tend to be easy to maintain and TREND: GLOBALIZATION repair locally. They are the opposite of the short-lived, use-and-discard, two-wash-two-wear model of mainstream consumer products. As you will read in the pages that follow, “nobody with a MakerBot will ever have to buy shower curtain rings again”.[4]\nAnother open source manifesto states, “Don’t judge an object for what it is, but imagine what it could become.” This clarion call is welcome – but it does not promise an easy ride for open design. Our world is littered with the unintended outcomes of design actions, and open design is unlikely to be an exception. For example, 90% of the resources taken out of the ground today become waste within three months – and it’s not axiomatic that open design will improve that situation. RECYCLING On the contrary, it’s logically possible that a network of Fab Labs could produce the open source equivalent of a gas-guzzling SUV. The long-term value of open design will depend on the questions it is asked to address.\nAn important priority for open source design, therefore, is to develop decision-making processes to identify and prioritize those questions. What, in other words, should open designers design? All our design decisions, from here on, need to take into account our natural, industrial and cultural systems – and the interactions between them – as the context for our creative efforts. We need to consider the sustainability of material and energy flows in all the systems and artefacts we design. In reading the articles and case studies that follow in this book, I am confident that these caveats will be embraced by the smart and fascinating pioneers of open design who are doing such fascinating work. Crowds may be wise – but they still need designers.\n\nKropotkin, P, ‘Foreword’, in Smith, T, French Gardening, London: Joseph Fels, 1909, p. vii-viii.

And yet, here we are. We can now easily download designs DOWNLOADABLE DESIGNfrom the internet, alter them at will to suit our own needs and then produce perfect products at the push of a button. Magic.\nBack to the Future\nIn many ways though, there are huge similarities here to much older practices of production and consumption. The emergence of Do It Yourself DIYas a necessity for many is lost in the mists of time, but defined as a leisure pursuit, a pastime, it emerged from a perceived need to ‘keep idle hands busy’. In the hours following a long working day, it acted only to bring the Victorian work ethic from the factory into the home. DIY = productive leisure.\nIn promoting DIY as an amateur pastime, the profes-sional practices of design (which had themselves only appeared a short while earlier) were democratized. The printing of instructional manuals in the form of popular DIY handbooks and magazines enabled anyone having developed the necessary hand skills (which were then passed down from generation to generation) to engage with creative design and production processes and make functional items for themselves.1This process of democratization was not all plain sailing – it was one which was strongly rejected by the institutional bodies of various professions, all seeking to protect the livelihoods of their members, and was a source of tension in the relationship between amateur and professional which remains to this day.2\nAt first, technological developments in the design of tools and the development of new materials aided this opening up of professional practice. Some of the key turning points included the emergence of domestic versions of professional power tools, beginning with the electric drill,3DIYand the ready availability of new materials such as hardboard, plastic laminates, ready-mixed paints and adhesives. At a time when many products in the home, from furniture to kitchen fittings and from radios to standard lamps, were produced in relatively small numbers from materials such as wood and metal, these developments effectively de-skilled production processes, meaning that the individual handyman could fairly easily design and build many of the products of everyday life. However, as the professions became more and more specialized and further removed from everyday activities, technology became more complex and esoteric and the mass production of injection-moulded plastic parts became the norm, the design and manufacture of many products moved beyond the capabilities of all but the most dedicated of DIY practitioners, and the creative process moved further away from the hand of the individual. Allied to this, the lack of free time in increasingly busy private lives, and the economies of scale involved in mass production provided further disincentives. Why bother to build a bookcase yourself, when a professionally designed, perfectly well made and highly finished self-assembly version can be bought for less than the cost of the raw materials?\n\nDO IT YOURSELF CAN BE SEEN AS: PRODUCTIVE LEISURE.\n\nThis distancing of the professional from the amateur in part contributed to the cult of the connoisseur: the idea of the professional designer as one who knew what was best for everyone, no matter who they were. The grand narrative of modernist design sought singular perfection and brought an elitist view of ‘good taste’ to the forefront of any design debate. This view held sway and did not even begin to be dismantled until the realization in the 1960s that a single design solution could not possibly fulfil the requirements of such a wide and heterogeneous market, and that the relevance of any particular design was determined by its user, not its creator.4Slowly, the opinion of the user grew in importance and more enlightened design practitioners began to promote user-centred design processes, where the observed requirements of the user formed the starting point of creative product development. The logical progression of this view can be seen in the more recent emergence of co-creation design processes, where the user is finally fully involved in the creative process leading to the products they eventually consume. It is a short step from co-creation CO-CREATIONor co-design to a position where users take on the responsibility for creative and productive acts in their entirety – a step which technology has now enabled everyone to make. In open design, the cult of the connoisseur has given way to the cult of the amateur:5those who know themselves what is best for them.\nThe processes of technological development that have variously brought amateur and professional closer together or driven them further apart are now acting to potentially remove the barriers between the two completely.6The open distribution network of the internet promotes an interactive and iterative process of creative design development amongst a globally dispersed group of potentially anonymous participants: a virtual band of individuals who can coalesce around a particular design problem, and who may or may not include design professionals. COMMUNITYAfter ‘solving’ a particular design problem, the band dissolves, only to reform with a different membership around a new problem. Furthermore, the people in this virtual band have at their disposal advanced manufacturing capabilities.\nThe appearance of Rapid Prototyping HELLO WORLDtechnologies in the mid-1980s, at first high-level and hugely expensive machines, allowed mass production processes requiring investment in costly tooling to be neatly sidestepped, making it possible to produce one-off products cost-effectively. Low-cost descendants of these – the designs for which are themselves disseminated and downloaded via the internet and made by hand – now enable the desktop manufacture of individualized products in the home.DOWNLOADABLE DESIGNTechnology has moved the goalposts from a position of co-creation to one where the user has the capability to completely design and manufacture products by themselves. It is a return, if you will, to a cottage industry model of production and consumption that has not been seen since the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution. What at first glance appears to be a futuristic fantasy is revealed, in fact, to be just the opposite: a recurrence of past ways of doing things.\nOrchestral Manoeuvres\nWe have seen how this situation of open design and production occurred through the technological development of tools and materials, and a change in the standing of the individual’s opinion. Both factors increased in importance with the introduction of wide accessibility to the internet and low-cost machines for direct digital manufacture. We can safely assume that open source versions of these machines, such as the ‘CupCake’ CNC rapid prototyping machine produced by MakerBot Industries7, the desktop rapid prototyper ‘Model 1 Fabber’ from Fab@Home8, or the self-replicating rapid prototyper the ‘RepRap9’, will continue to grow in capability, becoming more and more efficient, more accurate and able to use a wider range of raw materials. Such is the nature of open development.10\nIN OPEN DESIGN, THE CULT OF THE CONNOISSEUR HAS GIVEN WAY TO THE CULT OF THE AMATEUR – THOSE WHO KNOW THEMSELVES WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM.\nIt appears, then, that there are two physical aspects to be considered in making such technologies more acceptable to the wider public: the development of more user-friendly interfaces, or more intuitive systems for creating three-dimensional designs in the first place; and the distribution of materials in forms suitable for use in such machines. No doubt web-based supply infrastructures will appear as a matter of course as the demand for materials increases, but many current open design systems still require fairly high-level CAD modelling skills KNOWLEDGE in order to produce designs in a digital form.\nSince 2002, I have been leading research projects within the Post Industrial Manufacturing Research Group, initially at the University of Huddersfield and since 2008 at Sheffield Hallam University. This work has explored the development of effective user interfaces to enable the open design of products, with the express intention of increasing amateur involvement in the design process and reducing the distance between amateur and professional. It has pushed such technologies through projects by the industrial designer Lionel T. Dean11and by the artist/maker Justin Marshall.12\nFuture Factories\nThe web portal of FutureFactories allowed observers to watch computer models of organic forms for products such as light fittings, candlesticks and furniture randomly mutating in real time, freeze the design at any point and save the resulting file for later production by rapid prototyping. Marshall’s Automake project went a stage further, and gave the user more ability to interact with the design by allowing them to manipulate various computer-generated mesh envelopes within which selected components would randomly be placed by the computer until a finished form appeared, which could then be printed. PRINTING Depending on the mesh chosen and the scale selected, the finished results could range from fruit bowls and vases down to bracelets and rings.\nThe exhibition I curated at the Hub National Centre for Design and Craft in May 2008  EVENTS  showed the results of both these projects and allowed visitors to the exhibition to try out the Automake software for themselves. The outputs created were first printed out as colour photographs, becoming part of a growing display wall. A selection of those photographs were printed in 3D AESTHETICS: 3D by the industrial sponsor each week and added to the exhibition. Visitors returned again and again to see the expanding displays, with those whose work was selected and manufactured proudly bringing friends and relatives to see the results of their endeavours. These people said it was the first creative thing they had ever done, and that they could not have achieved it without the Automake system. The system enabled them to engage in a form of design and production that questioned their familiar relationship with the object.\nGenerative Software\nNumerous systems that employ generative software and allow users to manipulate designed forms for pieces of jewellery and then have them produced by lost-wax casting or laser cutting followed soon after. One of the best known is ‘Nervous System’.13Visitors to their site can either buy ready-made pieces created using their software, or run various simple interactive applets and manipulate screen designs based on organic structures such as amoebas, orchids, lichen and algae to create their own unique pieces, which can then be saved and manufactured by the supplier.AESTHETICS: 3D The result is a growing open design library of unique but closely related forms. The code for the software is also released under a Creative Commons licence to encourage others to produce similar work.\n\nTHE GRAPHIC DESIGNER’S ROLE HAS MOVED FROM CREATING FIXED PRODUCTS TO A MORE FLUID DIGITAL PRESENCE, WHERE THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY IN CONTROL OF THE CONTENT CONSTANTLY BEING ADDED TO THEIR ORIGINAL CREATION.\n\nThese examples underline the value of systems that allow complex three-dimensional forms to be created by users who, for very valid reasons of lack of time and inclination, are unlikely to develop the type of Computer-Aided Design skills and 3D design awareness required on their own. The development of systems to help and support such people in the creation of their own designs should not be seen as a threat to professional designers – who might see their widespread adoption as an affront to their creative expertise and high-level training – but as an opportunity to retain key roles in the design of products. It would seem certain that the role of the designer in this situation will change rather than disappear altogether, and that this change in role will bring with it the requirement for a change in the attitude of the designer with respect to their relationship with the finished object, as well as in their relationship to the amateur user. Traditional models of authorship and ownership and the existing legal structures over rights and liabilities do not sit well with open systems of design and production, and trying to maintain them will only lead to heartbreak and disappointment. These lessons have already been learned in the allied creative industries of graphics, film and music production as they have tried to protect their income streams, and need to be heeded here.14\nGraphic designers have had to learn to cope with the fact that anybody with a computer and the right software has access to the means to create and produce high-quality, finished pieces of graphic design (although the nature of the systems in place often fails to help lay users create anything that would be mistaken for ‘professional’ work). In many instances, the graphic designer’s role has moved from creating fixed, printed products to originating and possibly maintaining a much more fluid digital presence such as websites, where they may not be totally in control of the content constantly being added to their original creation.\nThe issues that the music industry has had to deal with include not only the enormous and unsettling changes to the processes of how their end products are distributed, but also the opening up of the existing processes of sourcing new, original material. The role of the A+R (Artist and Repertoire) person – acting as a ‘professional’ arbiter of taste and a filter between the plethora of bands aiming to get recording contracts and those that actually get them – has been replaced by the self-promotion and distribution of music by bands acting as their own producers, which is then filtered first-hand by potential listeners as part of a global online audience. Similarly, film studios have been subjected to huge amounts of ‘amateur’ AMATEURISSIMO material being made widely available through websites such as YouTube, which is filtered by enormous numbers of viewers rather than by a director.\nThe analogy alluded to here, between the role of the designer and the role of the film director, music producer, or orchestra conductor for that matter, is a good one. While the director is recognized as the creative force behind the film, it is widely understood that the process of film production is intrinsically a team effort of co-creation CO-CREATION involving a large cast of equally creative individuals. Likewise, an orchestra cannot function well without a conductor, but while the conductor’s role is key, the quality of the orchestral music produced relies on the active involvement of all the musicians. Perhaps what we are seeing here is the transition of the designer’s role (which in reality has more often than not been one of co-creation in any case, working as they do with teams of engineers, ergonomists, marketing experts and a host of others) to a role more akin to that of a film director or orchestra conductor – with the cast or orchestra in this instance including every end user. The professional designer, I suspect, will become an agent of design, with the audience of end users selecting which designer’s system they wish to employ.\n\nTHE PROFESSIONAL DESIGNER WILL BECOME AN AGENT OF DESIGN, WITH THE AUDIENCE OF END USERS SELECTING WHICH DESIGNER’S SYSTEM THEY WISH TO EMPLOY.\n\nThis anticipated change of role would potentially have a huge impact. The relationship between the designer and the objects they initiate will change, as they might never see or even be aware of the results of their endeavours, changed as they will be by users to suit their own needs. HACKING DESIGN The relationship between the user and the products they own changes too, as they move from being passive consumers of designed products to active originators of their own designs. Indeed, the terms ‘amateur’ and ‘professional’ may well disappear as we move into this ‘post-professional’ era. Design education will also have to change its curriculum, perhaps moving closer to the learning style used in craft training – teaching students to create more meaningful, individual pieces rather than huge numbers of identically mass produced products. Designers will have to learn to develop systems that will be used by others rather than trying to remain the sole author of their own work. And while it might seem daunting for the designer to be further removed from the end product they design, it is in fact a huge opportunity for the designer to become far more closely involved with the process of production than before, with all the associated knowledge and awareness of material quality and behaviour that implies. The challenge will be to create systems that enable the design integrity of the end result to be retained and perhaps the identity of the original design intention to be perceived, while still allowing a degree of freedom for individual users to adapt designers’ work to their own ends.\nThese orchestral manoeuvres in design will change everything for everybody, but while there may be troubles ahead, it is not all doom and gloom. The innate ability of design to adapt to change will surely be its saviour.\nNOTES\n\nSee Atkinson, P, ‘Do It Yourself: Democracy and Design’,Journal of Design History, 19(1), 2006, p. 1-10. \n“[P]rofessional attitudes to [amateur design] activities have continued to oscillate between fear and admiration.” Beegan, G and Atkinson, P, ‘Professionalism, Amateurism and the Boundaries of Design’,Journal of Design History, 21(4), 2008, p. 312.\nWilhelm Emil Fein invented the first electric hand drill in 1895.

The roles of creator and consumer are starkly defined and contrasted. As the public grew accustomed to the idea of passive consumption, creativity became increasingly marginalized, at least in those areas covered by copyright. ACTIVISM Creativity was perceived as capable of flourishing only through the patronage of the movie studios, the record companies or the TV stations.\nThe industrial technology behind printing, broadcasting and vinyl duplication is expensive. Copyright law grants a monopoly which enables the distributors of media to invest in the capital infrastructure required for their packaging and distribution. These are the businesses which grew fat on the monopolies so granted, and they succeeded in convincing the public that it was the corporations’ role to provide, and the public’s role to pay and consume.\nThe original social approach to creativity did not become extinct as the dominant producer/consumer mode became established, even for media (like music, for example) where it applied. Andrew Douglas’s film_Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus_shows that a visitor to the late 20th century Appalachians of the American South may well be asked: “What instrument do you play?” If the visitor answers: “I don’t play any”, the questioner will go on to say: “Ok, so you must sing.”\nSteven Johnson inWhere Good Ideas Come From_makes the convincing case, based on a mass of evidence, that the social mode is more effective at maximizing creativity than relying on lone inventors and creators sitting in their garrets and sheds. Lone creators make good central figures in a compelling narrative – one reason why this meme is so popular. However, examining the truth behind the narrative often reveals that any creative work has much broader parentage than the story suggests. James Boyle in_The Public Domain_reveals the story behind the Ray Charles song_I Got a Woman, tracing it backwards to Gospel roots, and forwards to the YouTube mashup George BushDoesn’t Care About Black People, which sprang to prominence in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. To be sure, companies sometimes tried to foster a social model_within_the organization, but as Johnson points out, the benefits of social creation increase very dramatically with the size of the pool of participants, due to network effects. Until company silos are able to combine, the beneficial effects are relatively small.\nTechnology is Expensive\nThe internet has proved hugely disruptive. TREND: NETWORK SOCIETY The sharing and social nature of Web 2.0 has enabled the rediscovery of the natural, human, social mode of creative endeavour. The social side of the internet is dominated by individuals acting in their private capacity, outside the scope of businesses. Companies were initially wary of losing control over the activities of their staff, and regarded internet social activities as time-wasting at best. In the worst-case scenario, businesses saw online social networking as a potential channel for employees to leak the company’s valuable intellectual property, and were therefore often slow to see the benefits of social interaction in terms of benefits to their creativity. As they have seen the benefits accrue to their competitors, however, compa-nies are starting to embrace a more open mode of business.\nA return to the social mode is not without its setbacks. The internet radically lowered the barrier to entry for collaborative participation, and consequently increased the number of potential contacts that an entrant can make. SHARING This immensely powerful engine of creativity comes with a brake that inhibits its full capacity: the effect of unfit-for-purpose copyright laws.\nThe copyright laws of the broadcast era do more to assist the incumbent gatekeepers (the film companies, music companies and so on) than to promote the social mode of CO-CREATION collaboration. A side effect of the digital world is that almost every form of digital interaction involves copying of some sort. Whereas copyright law had nothing to say about sharing a book with a friend by lending it to her, in the digital realm, lending her a digital copy of_Nineteen Eighty-Four_to read on her e-book reader or computer involves a form of copying which may potentially violate copyright law.\nThe broadcast-model gatekeepers have used this unintended side effect of copyright law to their advantage, taking action against private individuals who had no intention of monetary gain, including mash-up artists, REMIX home video enthusiasts and slash fiction authors. Incumbent rights holders, fearful of losing their profitable monopoly-based businesses, have sought to extend their rights ever further by lobbying governments (frequently successfully) to legislate for new and increased intellectual property rights, extending such rights far beyond their original purpose and intention. To put the issue in context, it is necessary to ask a fundamental question: what is copyright for?\nThomas Jefferson was one of the most lucid writers on the topic. He understood well the unique nature of knowledge:\n“If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.”[1]\nA Monopoly is a Bad Thing\nJefferson did admit that creative people should be given a limited right of exclusive control over their creations. A monopoly is inherently a bad thing, a fact that was recognized in the late 18th century, as it is today. Nonetheless, a monopoly of control in the form of copyright or a patent was the most convenient way of enabling the creators to be remunerated for their work. And once the monopoly expired, the idea would be freely available to all and would become part of the common heritage of mankind, to be used without restriction by anyone. The necessary (but limited) monopoly includes ‘copyright’. The principle that the restrictions should be the minimum possible to achieve that aim should be copyright’s golden rule.That golden rule has been repeatedly ignored. The scope of protection has increased steadily over the last three hundred years, to the extent that the protection granted in Europe to the author of a novel, for example, lasts for seventy years after his or her death. Materials that are not restricted by intellectual property are considered to be ‘in the public domain’. Commentators have become increasingly strident in arguing that the public domain is a public good; it is likely that Jefferson would have agreed. In the same way that common land is an area where anyone can allow their animals to graze, the public domain has been described as a commons of knowledge, where potentially anyone can graze on the intellectual creations of others. The public domain has one crucial difference from a commons in the tangible world: a meadow open to all can easily be over-grazed and ruined, so that it becomes of use to no one (sometimes referred to as the ‘tragedy of the commons’). It is impossible to exhaust the commons of knowledge and ideas.\nThe Tragedy of the Commons\nThe modern ‘tragedy of the commons’ is that, just as the internet makes it easier to pass ideas and knowledge KNOWLEDGEfrom one person to another (for “the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition”), it seems that legislation and the more extreme activities of the rights holders are making it more difficult for those ideas and knowledge to enter the commons in the first place. This is because the duration of intellectual property is constantly being extended (will the early Mickey Mouse films ever enter the public domain?), and so is its scope, as evidenced by the patenting of genes or plants. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the value of the commons and are seeking to protect it. At the same time, we are gradually realizing that the monopoly granted by intellectual property laws is a blunt instrument, and that people are prepared to create for reasons other than the expectation of payment for the use of their creation. Copyright law does not always have to work against the commons. Free and open source software has been an undeniable success. Gartner confidently states that all businesses today use at least some free software in their systems; the Linux Foundation is predicting that free software will underpin a $50 billion economy in 2011. Following from these and other successes, the applicability of the open source model has been considered in other contexts.\nThe Creative Commons Licenses\nOne of the most prominent open source models has been the Creative Commons CREATIVE COMMONSmovement. Founded in 2001, Creative Commons has written a suite of licences which were inspired by the GNU/GPL, but which are intended for use in relation to a broad range of media, including music, literature, images and movies. The licences are drafted to be simple to understand and are modular, in that the rights owner can choose from a selection of options. The_attribution_option requires that anyone making use of the work makes fair attribution to the author; the_share alike_option is akin to the GPL, in that if a licensee takes the work and redistributes it (whether amended or not), then the redistribution needs to be on the same form of licence; the_no derivatives_option means that work may be passed on freely, but not modified, and the_non-commercial_option means that the work can only be used and distributed in a non-commercial context.\nThere are now millions of different works available under a Creative Commons licence: Flickr is just one content hosting site which has enabled Creative Commons licensing as a search option. There are, at the time of writing, nearly 200,000,000 Creative Commons-licensed images available for use on Flickr alone. Similar sites provide music and literary works under a Creative Commons licence. Creative Commons provide a legal infrastructure for designers and other creatives operating within the digital domain to adopt this model. They also offer an effective choice as to whether an appropriate model is GPL-style share-alike, or BSD style. Where designers’ DESIGNERSwork moves into the physical world, matters become much less straightforward. The movement of hardware design into the commons has been difficult. The fundamental issues can be summarized as follows:\n→ In the digital world, the creator has the choice of whether a GPL or BSD model is appropriate. This choice does not translate well to the analogue world.\n→ Digital works are relatively easy to create and test.on low-cost equipment. Analogue works are more difficult to create, test and copy, which creates barrier-to-entry problems.\n→ Digital goods are easy to transport; analogue goods are not. This creates a barrier to the communication necessary to get the maximum benefit out of network effects.\nThe barrier to entry for any participant in a digital project is remarkably low. A low-cost computer and basic internet access are all that is required to have a system capable of running the (free) GNU/Linux operating system, accessing (free) project hosting sites likesourceforge.comorkoders.com. A vast range of tools required to develop software (such as GCC – the GNU Compiler Collection) are also available as free software. Copying purely digital works is trivially easy. Physical (or ‘analogue’) objects are a different matter.\nHardware development is likely to require more intensive investment in equipment (including premises in which the hardware can be placed), not just for development, but for testing. Electronic digital hardware is probably closest to software in terms of low barrier to entry: for example, the open-source Arduino microcontroller project enables an experimenter to get started with as little as $30 for a basic USB controller board (or less, if the experimenter is prepared to build the board). Arduino’s schematics, board layouts and prototyping software are all open source. BLUEPRINTSHowever, Arduino-like projects represent the lowest barrier to entry in the hardware world.\nComplications of Analogue\nAn Arduino-style project is essentially a hybrid of the analogue and the digital domains. Prototyping software makes it possible to develop Arduino-based hardware in the digital domain, where it retains all the characteristics of the digital world: ease of copying, the ability to upload prototypes to fellow contributors for commentary, assistance and the chance to show off. These are characteristics which enable network effects, and which make the open source model very powerful. It is only when the project is implemented as a physical circuit board that these characteristics are lost.\nThe analogue world is not always so simple. One of the most ambitious open source projects is the 40 Fires/Riversimple hydrogen car project, which has developed a small urban car (the Hyrban) powered by hydrogen, using a fuel cell/electric drivetrain. Elements of the design (such as power control software or the dashboard user interface) can be developed largely in the digital domain, but the development of motors, brakes, the body shell and so on are strictly analogue only. WYS ≠ WYGNot only do these analogue elements present a large barrier to entry for interested tinkerers, but they also tend to restrict their ability to participate in the development community: a necessity if network effects are to work. It is, clearly, difficult to upload a car to a development site and say “can you tell me why the windscreen leaks?”\n\nCOPYRIGHT PROTECTS THE EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA. RETAINING THE SAME IDEA, BUT RECASTING THE EXPRESSION OF IT IN A DIFFERENT FORM, DOES NOT INFRINGE ON THE COPYRIGHT.\n\nAnother significant issue is the lack of access to design software at a low cost. Software developers have access to high-quality tools like development environments and tools available for free under free software licences. There is no similar suite of CAD software, and proprietary CAD software is notoriously expensive. The barrier to entry is raised once again.\nMany of these issues are surmountable, given time. Ever-improving simulation software means that more and more testing and prototyping can be undertaken in the digital domain. The introduction of 3D printers PRINTINGlike the RepRap means that it is becoming increasingly affordable and feasible to print physical objects, such as gears, from a variety of plastics. The lack of suitable CAD software is being addressed by a number of projects.\nFor designers, progress in open source tools, increased connectivity and so on makes the establishment of open source communities ever more feasible. The legal issues, however, are less straightforward.\nSo far, we have concentrated on copyright issues. In some ways, other forms of intellectual property pose greater challenges. Copyright protects the expression of an idea. Retaining the same idea, but recasting the expression of it in a different form, does not infringe on the copyright. The story of two people from warring tribes meeting, falling in love, and dying in tragic circumstances can be told in a myriad of different ways, each with their own independent copyright, none of which infringes on anyone else’s copyright. This has two practical consequences. The first is that if a creator creates something which he or she has not copied from something else, then the creator will not be in breach of copyright, even if their creation turns out to be very similar, or even identical, to someone else’s. The second is that if a component of something is found to be infringing on a copyright, it is possible to salvage the project by recasting the same idea in a different expression. REMIX\nDesign Rights\nCopyright also has the advantage of being (reasonably well) harmonized worldwide, and has also proved amenable to hacking (e.g. by Richard Stallman) HACKINGso that it can be used to guarantee openness in the code it covers. However, other forms of intellectual property protection are more problematic for designers.\nThis issue is linked to the distinction between the analogue and digital domains. Designs almost invariably start with some sort of drawing or description, which is protected by copyright as a literary or artistic work. Often, this material will be digital in nature. At this point, it is similar to software. Licensing options include the suite of Creative Commons licences. Once an item is created in the physical world, a different set of legal considerations applies.\nThe most obvious is design right. Unfortunately, design right is complex and uncoordinated. There are many different types of design rights, and they differ from country to country. In the UK, for example, there are four separate design right regimes operating simultaneously. Depending on the right in question, they cover aspects such as shape, texture, colour, materials used, contours and ornamentation. Registered designs are in many ways similar to patents; in fact, they are sometimes called petty patents or design patents. Infringement can be unintentional, and independent creation is irrelevant. Unregistered designs are more in the nature of copyrights, and are vulnerable to infringement only where copying has taken place. The very fact that registration of design rights is required in itself provides a barrier to entry for collaborative projects, whereas copyright arises automatically and without the necessity of registration. On a collaborative project, who will pay for the preparation of a design registration, and who will make the application and maintain it?\nPatents\nPatents provide a particular problem for both programmers and designers, as they can impinge on both the digital realm and the analogue realm. Patents are a protection on the idea itself. Regardless of how that idea is expressed, its expression would represent patent infringement. Independent invention does not excuse patent infringement. The only way to be sure that an invention does not infringe a patent is to do an exhaustive check in patent offices worldwide. Such checks are very rarely carried out, since the expense is enormous and creates a vast barrier to entry for small businesses. US law in particular applies a positive disincentive to search: if a search is undertaken, then the searcher can be deemed to have knowingly infringed a patent – even if their reasonable determination was that the patent was not infringed – and will be liable to triple damages as a consequence. Pressure groups are lobbying worldwide for a reform of the patent system and process, but at present it is clear that the system benefits incumbent large companies with an existing patent portfolio.\nThe upshot of the intellectual property issues is that the BSD model is the only viable option in the hardware, analogue world. In contrast, those operating wholly in the digital domain (which includes programmers, but which can also extend to digital creatives such as filmmakers, novelists or graphic designers) have the ability to choose whether they prefer the GPL model to the BSD model, for a number of reasons. In brief, the two main reasons are as follows:\nCopyright, being largely universal, automatic, unregistered and long-lasting, is better suited to the development of a copyleft model than other forms of intellectual property. The difference in cost between copying and reverse engineering WYS ≠ WYG(which is vast in digital world, but much smaller in the analogue world), makes the copyleft a less compelling problem. A more detailed discussion of these reasons is needed to clarify why they are pertinent.\n\nTHE SYSTEM BENEFITS INCUMBENT LARGE COMPANIES WITH AN EXISTING PATENT PORTFOLIO.\n\nIf a GPL model were applied to hardware designs, in order to be effective, it would need to impinge on the ideas underlying the design (patents), or on the visual characteristics of the design (design rights). A GPL-style model based on patents would likely fail because of the cost, complexity, and time involved in applying for the patents – not to mention the necessity of keeping the invention secret prior to its publication, since part of the application process squares badly with the open source ethos. If the model were based on design rights, it would fail in relation to registered design rights, for the same reasons as for patents. If it were based on unregistered design rights, it would be unlikely to work because the scope and length of protection would be too short, and because the rights are insufficiently universal (although there is some scope for a limited GPL-style model in relation to unregistered design rights). Even if a GPL model were feasible in the world of hardware, there is an economic reason why it would be unlikely to work. The reasoning is as follows: the digital world makes things extremely easy to copy. Imagine a programmer wants to create some software based on a program with similar functionality to a word processor released under the GPL. The options are either to take the original GPL program, modify it, and release the result under the GPL; or to take the GPL program, reverse-engineer it, and rewrite a whole new program from scratch, which would be unencumbered by copyright restrictions. There is a vast difference in the amount of work involved in the two scenarios, and any programmer is likely to consider very seriously adopting the easier, cheaper and quicker option (modifying the original), where the ‘cost’ is licensing under the GPL. However, to offer a different example, even if there were a functioning mechanism for applying share-alike to a mechanical assembly, an engineer wishing to reproduce the mechanical assembly would, in effect, have to reverse-engineer it in order to set up the equipment needed to reproduce it. Copying a digital artefact is as simple as typing:\ncp old.one new.one\nCopying an analogue artefact is vastly more difficult. REPRODUCTIONConsequently, there is little difference between slavish copying, which would invoke GPL-like restrictions, and reverse-engineering and re-manufacturing, which would not. In this case, it is much more likely that the ‘cost’ of GPL-like compliance would be greater than the benefits of having a GPL-free object. In conclusion, even if GPL-style licences were effective in the physical world, economics would tend to disfavour their use.\nIt can therefore be stated that designers operating in the analogue realm are likely to be restricted to an openness model more akin to BSD than to GPL. Their challenges are to make this model work, and to discourage free riders with a combination of moral pressure and a demonstration that playing by the community norms will be beneficial both to them, and to the community as a whole.\nBenefiting from Connected Creativity\nDesigners and creators are increasingly able to benefit from the promise of the connected, social mode of creativity. The way was paved by free software pioneers, who skilfully hacked HACKINGthe copyright system to generate a commons which has not only generated a huge global business, but also provided the software which runs devices from mobile phones through to the most powerful supercomputers. It provides the software which gives the developing world access to education, medical information and micro-finance loans and enables them to participate in the knowledge economy on similar terms to the developed nations.\n\nDESIGNERS AND CREATORS ARE INCREASINGLY ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROMISE OF THE CONNECTED, SOCIAL MODE OF CREATIVITY.\n\nThe challenge for designers and creators in other fields is to adapt the model of software development to their own field of work, and to counter the extensive efforts of incumbent beneficiaries of the broadcast era to use ever more draconian legislation to prop up the outmoded business models. Ultimately, the social mode will win: it takes one of humanity’s defining characteristics, the fact that we are highly social and community-oriented, and uses it as the foundation of the entire structure. One-to-many works against this fundamental trait, but Nature will ultimately triumph.\n\nGNU/GPL AND BSD LICENSES\nIn the late 1980s, computer programmer Richard Stallman realized that copyright law could be turned inside out to create a commons of computer software. The method he proposed was simple, but brilliant.\nSoftware is protected by copyright. The software business model used in the 1980s involved granting customers permission (the licence) to use a specific piece of software. This licence was conditional on the customer not only paying the software publisher fee, but also adhering to a number of other restrictions (such as only using the software on one computer). Why not, Stallman reasoned, make it a condition of the licence that if you took his software and passed it on (which he was happy for people to do), then they had to pass it on, together with any changes they made, under the same licence? He called this sort of software ‘free software’: once a piece of software has been released under this sort of licence, it can be passed on freely to other people, with only one restriction: that if they pass it on, in turn, they must also ensure that it is passed it on in a way that guarantees and honours that freedom for other people.\nIn time, he reasoned, more and more software would be released under this licence, and a commons of freely available software would flourish. The most widely used version of the licence is the GNU General Public License version 2, known as the GPL. In the 19 years since it was issued, it has become the most commonly used software licence. The GPL is the licence at the core of Linux, the computer operating system which powers Google, Amazon and Facebook, and which enabled Red Hat to forecast revenue in excess of $1Bn in financial year 2010-11.\nThe software commons envisioned by Stallman not only exists; by any measure, it has been an overwhelming success. Its success can be measured in countless ways: the number of participants creating software for that GPL commons, the number of open source software programs in use, or the environments in which such software can be found. More than 90 of the 100 most powerful computers in the world run on GPL software, not to mention mobile phones and in-car entertainment systems; open source software is at the core of the business offerings of such large companies as IBM and Red Hat.\nThe Commons Analogy\nThe success of free software cannot be solely attributed to the GPL. The GPL extracts a price for using the commons. To risk taking the analogy too far, a landowner who has property adjoining the GPL commons and who wants to use it also has to add his own land to the commons. (Remember, this is the magical land of ideas which cannot be ruined by over-grazing.) This will have the effect of increasing the size of the commons as more and more adjoining landowners want to make use of the commons and donate their own land in the process. However, many of them may not want to join this scheme, either because they do not want to add their own land to the commons, or because they have already pledged their land to another commons.\nIs it possible to generate a commons of ideas without forcing participants to pay the price of entry; without requiring that they add their own adjoining land to the commons? Is the compulsion of the GPL necessary, or is the social and community dynamic powerful enough to allow a similar commons of ideas to spring up on its own?\nThe software industry has given us several outstanding examples of this. Apache, the most popular web server software in the world, used by many of the world’s busiest web sites, is issued under a licence which does not ask users to pay the GPL price. Anyone can take the Apache code, and modify it and combine it with their other software, and release it without having to release any sources to anyone else. In contrast to the GPL, there is no compulsion to add your software to the Apache commons if you build on Apache software and distribute your developments, but many people choose to contribute in return even without this compulsion. FreeBSD, to take another example, is an operating system bearing some similarity to GNU/Linux which is licensed under a very liberal licence allowing its use, amendment and distribution without contributing back; nonetheless, many people choose to do so.\nFree Riders\nA parallel development to the GPL was the BSD licence, first used for the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). As opposed to the GPL, the BSD licence only requires the acknowledgement of the original authors, and poses no restrictions on how the source code may be used. As a result, BSD-licensed code can be used in proprietary software that only acknowledges the authors.\nThe GPL tackles an issue called the free rider problem. Because BSD does not compel people to contribute back to the commons, those who take advantage without contributing back are called free riders. The question is whether free riders really are a problem (as the GPL band would maintain), or whether they are (as the BSD band would maintain) at worst a cost-free irritant, and at best, a cadre of people who will eventually see the light and start to contribute, once they recognize the benefits. Supporters of both the GPL and BSD models of licensing have similar aims. In both cases, they seek to support a software commons which will enable the social mode of creativity to flourish.\nWhile the BSD model could subsist in the absence of copyright, GPL relies (perhaps ironically) on copyright law to enforce its compulsion to share. It still remains an open question as to whether the better model is to use licensing to compel people to participate in the software commons, thus reducing the free rider problem (as with GPL), or whether voluntary engagement will result in a more active community (as with Apache). Designers working outside the digital domain will rarely have the chance to choose a GPL-style option.\n\nRIGHTS AND LICENSING SCHEMES\nThe re-use of designs is governed mainly by copyright, design rights and patents. Traditional open licensing schemes have been based on copyright, as this is the main intellectual property right which impinges on software, the most fertile ground for openness.\nSoftware licensing schemes include the GPL (which enforces copyleft) and BSD (which doesn’t). Software licences rarely work properly when applied to other works. For literary, graphic and musical works, the Creative Commons suite is more effective. They allow both copyleft (share alike) and non-copyleft options. They may work well when applied to underlying design documents, which are covered by copyright, and control the distribution of those documents, as well as the creation of physical objects from them, but (depending on the jurisdiction) their protection is unlikely to extend to copying the physical object itself. Some efforts have been made to create licences that cover hardware; the TAPR Open Hardware Licence is one example. However, these efforts have frequently been criticized for their lack of effectiveness.\nwww.opensource.org/licenses/index.html\n\nCREATIVE COMMONS AND DESIGN RIGHTS\nCreative Commons licensing is fundamentally based on copyright, and there is little clarity or consensus on how such licenses would operate in relation to design rights across the myriad different jurisdictions and types of rights.\nThose designers operating purely in the realm of copyright will find that there is already an existing structure of support in terms of Creative Commons licences and associated communities. Where other forms of intellectual property impinge, matters are far more murky. The Creative Commons licences are arguably drafted to be sufficiently broad as to cover unregistered design in certain circumstances. However, since they were not drafted with design rights in mind, it cannot be assumed that the copying of a three-dimensional object will automatically fall within the scope of such a license.\nwww.creativecommons.org\n\nSTRUCTURE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe rule of thumb for intellectual property is that all works are considered to be in the public domain, with intellectual property protection as the exception. However, this exception is highly diversified. Copyright protects the creative, original expression of an idea, whereas patents protect the idea itself and its technical specifications. Design rights cover aspects such as shape, texture, colour, materials, contours and ornamentation. Other forms of protection include trademarks, database rights and performers’ rights.\n\n\nJefferson, T. Letter to Isaac McPherson, 13 August 1813. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson.

It is a transition from the ‘internet of things’ to the things of the internet. Michel Avital analyses the main drivers behind open design, open innovation and open source. He describes the major features of open design and explores the preconditions for open design in relation to four aspects: object, process, practice and infrastructure, with a specific focus on infrastructure.\nMichel Avital\n‘Openness’ is a recurring and increasingly frequent theme in recent buzzwords that populate the discourse on the forefront of technology, fromopen source_via_open innovation to open design. A review of related articles in the popular press and trade magazines indicates that the modifier_open_often denotes better, cheaper and faster. Apparently, the qualities inherent in openness or being open have materialized as the underlying enablers that pave the way for creativity, innovation and prosperity. In keeping with the thrust of this volume, this article contextualizes open design, focusing in particular on the characteristics of the infrastructure that are most conducive to its generative capability in relationship to innovation.\nThe Context of Open Design\nOpenness pertains to accessibility. Openness is a relative characteristic that refers to the degree to which something is accessible to view, modify and use. The ability toview_refers to sharing SHARING content and the availability of detailed information about the subject matter. The ability to_modify_refers to sharing labour and empowering changes, improvements and extensions of subject matter. The ability to_use_refers to sharing ownership and enabling semi or unrestricted reuse of the subject matter or parts thereof. These are the three fundamental operations that are implied by accessibility. Subsequently, from a systems theory perspective, openness relates to the transparency and permeability of any natural or constructed boundaries. Yet openness is not merely a technical attribute that conveys flow or lack thereof; it is an embedded trait that pervades the structure of a thriving civil society. From a social perspective, openness is a core characteristic of an infrastructure that conveys and reinforces sharing, reciprocity, collaboration, tolerance, equity, justice and freedom. The application of openness, OPEN EVERYTHING as implied by various accessibility features, to a growing number of central ubiquitous practices that drive the human enterprise, has turned into a megatrend that can be labelled the_Rise of Open-X. Megatrends are widespread trends which have a major impact and are likely to affect all levels – individuals, organizations, markets, countries and civil society – for a long duration. Understanding megatrends TRENDS and their rolling effects can provide valuable information for developing futuristic scenarios and can subsequently help to shape current actions in anticipation of that future. So far, as described below, Open-X has materialized in various configurations that can be classified according to three archetypes: open innovation, open source and open design. The three archetypes are juxtaposed in the table on the previous page as a preliminary overview to point out their different respective value propositions and thrust (as a distributed collective action), core openness orientation, and prime actors involved.\nOpen Innovation\nThe value proposition and thrust of _open innovation _is ‘distributed knowledge’ processes that emphasize the _view-related _capabilities of openness. The prime actors of open innovation are organizations. According to the traditional doctrine, industry leaders self-create the most and the best ideas; innovation should therefore be fostered by internal development teams behind high organizational walls and protected as a trade secret. In contrast, according to open innovation, industry leaders make the best use of internal and external ideas to develop better business models. In other words, superior outcome should be expected with permeable boundaries between a firm and its environment, which allow idea flow, knowledgeKNOWLEDGE exchange, and intellectual property trade. Reaching out and tapping into external knowledge resources extends the generative and innovative capabilities of a firm, as demonstrated by industry leaders like Procter & Gamble, Boeing, Philips and many others. The tenets of open innovation have promoted the proliferation of communities of practice and laid the foundations of crowdsourcing. CROWDSOURCING\nOpen Source\nThe value proposition and thrust of_open source_is ‘distributed development’ processes that emphasize the_modification-related_capabilities of openness. The prime actors of open source are developers. The open source concept originated in the software industry; according to the traditional doctrine, software is developed in commercial software firms by professional personnel, guarded through legal and technical measures, and then licensed for a fee. In contrast, according to the open source business model, software is developed through coordinated peer production by independent volunteers.\n\nTHE APPLICATION OF OPENNESS TO A GROWING NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT DRIVE THE HUMAN ENTERPRISE, HAS TURNED INTO A MEGATREND THAT CAN BE LABELED THE RISE OF OPEN-X.\n\nSubsequently, everyone can freely access the source code, and can modify and redistribute it under the same terms, thus nourishing continuous cycles of improvement, adaptation, and extension in a distributed fashion. Reaching out and tapping into external development resources extends the generative and innovative capabilities of a core project. Inspired by the impact of high-profile projects like Linux and Mozilla Firefox, the tenets of the open source development, licensing and distribution model have promoted the proliferation of open source projects of all sorts – from digital content development (e.g. Wikipedia), via vehicles (e.g. c,mm,n) and beverages (e.g. Free Beer – Vores øl), to 3D printers (e.g. RepRap), just to name a few. OPEN EVERYTHING\nOpen Design\nThe value proposition and thrust of _open design _is ‘distributed manufacturing’ processes that emphasize the _use-related _capabilities of openness. The prime actors of open design are consumers. Although designers undoubtedly play a pivotal role in fostering open design by producing and sharing suitable design blueprints, BLUEPRINTS ultimately the consumers who engage in distributed manufacturing are the core players and _raison d’être _of open design. According to the traditional doctrine, design is mostly a preliminary stage prior to commercial manufacturing and distribution. In contrast, open design is directed toward consumers who engage in fabrication, passing over the conventional manufacturing and distribution channels. Open design implies that the design blueprints are publicly available, sharable, licensed under open-access terms, and distributed digitally in a general design specification file format (e.g. dxf, dwg). Moreover, open design is not black-boxed or exclusive; it implies reconfigurable and extensible design that can be fabricated in distributed and scalable fashions through commercially available, off-the-shelf, multi-purpose means of production.\nA structured description of the unique features and boundaries of open design is provided in the table on the next page. The inherent reconfiguration and extension potential of a user-driven open design reinforces the generative and innovative capabilities of consumers. The tenets of open design have inspired the development of public manufacturing facilities networks like Fab Lab, and laid the foundations of open design clearinghouses like Ponoko, Shareable and Instructables. In summary, the distinctions between the three archetypes of Open-X are more a matter of thrust and areas of application. They are not mutually exclusive. All three inherit the core features of openness and naturally overlap to some degree. Open design, for example, is not merely a matter of re-use and distributed manufacturing – it also entails sharing design blueprints and sharing extensions thereof, thus distributing knowledge and development. Building on the working definition of open design and an understanding of its unique features, the remainder of this article will discuss its potential, in particular addressing the infrastructure characteristics that are most conducive to its generative capability in the context of innovation.\nUnpacking Open Design\nOpen design signifies open-access digital blueprints that can be adapted at will to meet situated requirements, and can subsequently be used by consumers to fabricate products on demand by commercial, off-the-shelf production methods. The open design model diminishes the traditional vertical value chain that is formed by designer-manufacturer-distributor-consumer relationships and offers an alternative, open web of direct links between designers and consumers. The resulting short-spanned, transient and non-hierarchical relationships forge dynamic and flexible arrays of blueprints that are not only user-centred but also user-driven.\nThe discourse on open design encompasses a multitude of considerations: for example, design specification, fabrication, collaborative action, supply and value chain management, business models, legal aspects, technological infrastructure and normative values. The complexity of this ecology can be untangled to some extent by classifying the underlying issues of open design into four interdependent conceptual layers, as follows:\n_Object layer _refers to the _design blueprints _that enable and constrain the specification of the design artefacts. This layer encompasses the design and distribution of open design objects, that is, configurable and extensible blueprints that are available under open access license in online public repositories.\n_Process layer _refers to the _means of production _that enables and constrains the fabrication of the design objects. This layer encompasses open design fabrication, that is, the application and operation of commercial, off-the-shelf machinery like printers,  PRINTING  laser cutters or CNC machine tools to produce customized products with no custom-built moulds or machines.\n_Practice layer _refers to the _work practices _that enable and constrain the conception of the design processes. This layer encompasses open design culture, that is, the related nomenclature, professional standards, craftsmanship, rules of the trade, code of conduct, rituals and normative values.\n_Infrastructure layer _refers to the underlying _institutional and technical foundations _that enable and constrain the vitality of the design practices. This layer encompasses open design substructure, that is, the related legal system, market structure and technical archi—tecture that govern open design activities and future growth.\nThe discourse so far is focused on the object and process layers, with some touches upon the practice layer. However, quite surprisingly, despite its fundamental role, the infrastructure layer is virtually ignored.\n\nDesigning Generative Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure that governs open design activities, business models and development is based on the related code of law, market structure and technical architecture, which together enable and constrain most human activity systems in an attempt to balance inherent conflicts and pursue the common good. In a general sense, infrastructures are designed to promote fairness, wealth and operational efficiency. TEMPLATE CULTURE Much has been written about the general nature of infrastructures elsewhere, leaving no need to reiterate it here. Instead, let us elaborate on the generative capability of infrastructure as an additional area of concern that should be considered particularly in the context of developing infrastructure requirements for open design. In view of the generative character of design in general, and open design in particular, developing an appropriate infrastructure should aim to incorporate the structural features that are most conducive to creative processes and products. Building on the concept of generative design, I suggest a set of generalizable considerations for designing such infrastructures. More specifically, I propose that the infrastructure of open design should be evocative, engaging, adaptive, and open.\nGenerative design refers to the design considerations in developing an array of artefacts and interactions that support and enhancegenerative capacity– that is, the considerations in designing systems that are conducive to the ability of a person or group to produce new configurations and possibilities, to reframe the way we see and understand the world, and to challenge the normative status quo.1 People’s generative capacity is a key source of innovation; by definition, generative design aims to encapsulate the design directives that enhance and complement that human capability.\nIn general, generative capacity refers to having an evocative power or aptitude that can result in producing or creating something, or tapping into a source of innovation. In the context of open design infrastructure, the modifier ‘generative’ denotes that the noun it modifies is conducive to the production of something innovative or the discovery of new and hitherto unknown design alternatives. In other words, generative design refers here to the design requirements and considerations in developing open design infrastructures – that is, the related code of law, market structure and technical architecture – that augment people’s natural ability to innovate. Subsequently, four top-level design directives are suggested for infrastructures, as follows:\n_Generative infrastructure is evocative_Generative infrastructure inspires people to create something unique. It evokes new thinking and enables them to translate their ideas into a new context. The infrastructure can help to create the environment or conditions that are prone to those insights by generating and juxtaposing diverse frames that are not commonly associated with one another within an underlying context. Systemic features that drive evocative design enable, for example, seeing an object or situation from multiple perspectives, testing it in multiple situations, examining it at multiple degrees of granularity, and exploring multiple overlay configurations.\nGenerative infrastructure is engaging_Generative infrastructure is enchanting and holds the attention of people by inducing their natural playfulness and ‘flow experience’. The infrastructure TEMPLATE CULTURE can help in the creation of engaging environments or platforms that stimulate the users’ cognitive spontaneity and playfulness as well as overall positive affect state, thus encouraging further exploration, tinkering and experimentation. Systemic features that drive engaging design enable, for example, fostering positive affect and high spirit that stimulate a state of ‘_joie de vivre’, activating cognitive spontaneity induced by playfulness, and stirring up curiosity through intriguing challenges.\n_Generative infrastructure is adaptive_Generative infrastructure is flexible and conducive to effective use by a heterogeneous set of people in their own respective environments and for various tasks within an intended scope. It can be adapted with respect to the type of users or groups that it serves in diverse problem spaces. It is also simple to understand and easy for anyone to master. The infrastructure can help in the creation of adaptive systems or platforms that are flexible yet powerful enough to enable the generation of a continuous stream of new ideas and configurations. Systemic features that drive adaptive design enable, for example, user-induced tailoring and customization to meet situated needs, self-production of complementary extensions and features that meet new or initially unforeseen needs, automatic system-induced adaptation, and overall scalable functionality with no regard to size-related attributes.\n_Generative infrastructure is open_Generative infrastructure accentuates permeable boundaries and transparency that promote co-production, cross-fertilization and exchange of any kind. The infrastructure ARCHITECTURE can help in the creation of open systems or platforms that provide connectivity, enable transparency, allow information sharing, and encourage dialogue with no regard to institutionally or culturally imposed boundaries. Systemic features that drive open design enable, for example, free and unrestricted access to information, communication among all stakeholders, and the easy integration of third-party extensions by independent boundary-spanners. In summary, from the generative requirement perspective, infrastructures of open design should be evocative, engaging, adaptive and open. However, while the last two directives are clearly implied in the discourse of open design, the first two have not yet been addressed. Subsequently, the inclusion of evocative and engaging features in the infrastructure of open design, let alone in the discourse concerning its requirements, is strongly recommended. Although this conclusion might not be obvious for legislators, policymakers, managers, and engineers, it should be quite intuitive for designers.The expected proliferation of open design has far-reaching implications that are likely to extend well beyond design practices as such and have significant socio-economic effects on a global scale.\n\nAnother Brave New World\nOpen design presents entrepreneurs and agile companies with a grand opportunity to expand existing markets, to develop new ones, and to capture large shares from current market leaders. Mobilizing open design to generate organizational value and to boost its market position requires radical strategic and operational changes. However, the tight coupling between design and production, which has so far been instrumental in fostering economies of scope and competitive advantages for the current industry leaders, is now likely to hinder their agile capability and their ability to take advantage of the new vistas that are beginning to be afforded by open design.\n\nPEOPLE’S GENERATIVE CAPACITY IS A KEY SOURCE OF INNOVATION; BY DEFINITION, GENERATIVE DESIGN AIMS TO ENCAPSULATE THE DESIGN DIRECTIVES THAT ENHANCE AND COMPLEMENT THAT HUMAN CAPABILITY.\n\nThe adoption of open design practices by esta-blished industry leaders, let alone run-of-the-mill manufacturers, where the dominant culture and mode of product design has been shaped and reshaped over long periods, is likely to pose multiple challenges to these organizations at all levels, from the boardroom to the production floor. Subsequently, the resistance to change in these organizations is expected to reinforce the current tight coupling between product design and industrial manufacturing. Just as Amazon could conquer the market share of established retailers that were unable to adapt quickly enough to the new marketplace of e-commerce, emerging market players based on open design business models are likely to cannibalize the turf of established manufacturers that are entrenched in the old model of industrial production.\nFrom Push to Pull\nOpen design paves the way to the next iteration in the massive shift from push to pull business models. In general, push business models are based on top-down value chains where a line of a few mass-produced products is distributed broadly through value-driven downstream marketing techniques. In contrast, pull business models are based on bottom-up value chains where a line of customer-configured products are distributed individually through features-driven upstream marketing techniques. Whereas push models are based on economies of scale and emphasize cost efficiency, pull models are based on flexible manufacturing and emphasize mass ustomization. In previous centuries, most artefacts – from shoes to carriages – were custom-designed and built on demand by a craftsperson.Building on push business models, the industrial revolution almost wiped out cottage manufacturing and shifted its lion’s share to production lines and mass-scale manufacturing in factories that offer economies of scope and scale. Consequently, the resulting abundant supply of affordable products was instrumental to massive market expansion, higher living standards, and growing wealth across the board. This prosperity has come at the expense of product variety and personalization, as most notoriously conveyed by Ford’s remark “any color as long as it’s black”. MASS CUSTOMIZATION\n\nOPEN DESIGN INFUSES ‘DO IT YOURSELF’ WITH A WHOLE NEW MEANING THAT GOES FAR BEYOND COST SAVINGS OR THE JOY OF CRAFTING.\n\nThe advent of the internet has bestowed a new communication infrastructure that made it possible not only to exceed the economic accomplishments of industrialization, but also to offer an unprecedented variety of products and personalization thereof. The latter has been accomplished through pull business models and upstream marketing that take advantage of automated fulfilment and logistics centres supported by fast, wideband, many-to-many communication networks. The extent of product variety and personalization has been attained and fortified in three main phases enabled by the accessibility (i.e. ability to view, modify and change) afforded by the internet. In the first phase,_retailers_have introduced consumers to the ability to view up-to-date, rich and targeted information about off-the-shelf products, thus enabling them to make informed decisions. Then, in the second phase,_manufacturers_have introduced consumers to the ability to_modify_base products and specify a customized configuration thereof, thus enabling them to fine-tune a product according to their preferences. Finally, in the still-nascent third phase,_designers_have introduced to consumers the ability to_use_blueprints for self-managed fabrication, thus enabling them to gain full control over the features of the resulted product as well as its production process. In summary, as in a stage model, every phase builds upon the previous one to bring the consumers closer to the designers and to provide them with more control over what they get, how it is produced, and how it is delivered.\nThe Road Ahead\nOpen design is still nascent, yet it provides a springboard for radical changes in the way we acquire almost anything that is currently mass-produced. Open design presents a new way of design that complements new methods of fabrication, commonly branded as 3D printers PRINTING of all sorts. Open design infuses ‘Do It Yourself’ with a whole new meaning that goes far beyond cost savings or the joy of crafting. It allows consumers to be in charge and offers them an opportunity for full customization of an artefact, including a choice of features, materials and delivery options. It allows for continuous innovation and localization, which in turn has major implications for consumers in shoestring economies as well as in developed countries. It also provides a fertile ground for the development of new forms of organization, new business models, new supply chain structures, new varieties of products and services, and the like, as demonstrated in the many cases in this volume. Nonetheless, traditional design and mass manufacturing practices have been extremely valuable since the Industrial Revolution REVOLUTION and are unlikely to disappear in the future. Although the threat to the dominant technologies and practices may seem implausible, open design presents a clear alternative that may grow strong once it reaches a critical mass in the right socio-economic conditions. Open design is not a threat to designers’ livelihood. Quite the contrary; it opens new vistas and new opportunities and is likely to generate increased consumer appreciation of the role of designers. Moreover, it is likely to bring designers closer to the intended and unintended applications of their designs. Grand opportunities also imply undeveloped land. There is much development to do in all four layers of open design – the object, process, practice and infrastructure layers. To a large extent, the discourse mirrors the field; the most immediate attention is required in shaping practices and laying the foundations of the support infrastructures.\nConclusion\nIt has been suggested that open design stands for accessible design in the form of blueprints that are publicly open to view, modify and use under open-access terms. Moreover, open design often implies that the design blueprints are available via open-access digital repositories, that they can be adapted at will to meet situational requirements, and that they can be used by consumers to fabricate products on demand by commercial, off-the-shelf means of production. DOWNLOADABLE DESIGN Open design is generative. It is conducive to continuous re-design, adaption, refinement and extension. Open design is a potent elixir that mitigates stagnation and awakens generative action.\n\nSee Avital, M. and Te’eni, D, ‘From Generative Fit to Generative Capacity: Exploring an Emerging Dimension of Information Systems Design and Task Performance’, Information Systems Journal, 19(4), 2009, p. 345-367. ↩\n\n"},"topics/design-literacy.html":{"url":"topics/design-literacy.html","title":"Design Literacy: Organizing Self-organization","keywords":"","body":"DESIGN LITERACY: ORGANIZING SELF-ORGANIZATION / DICK RIJKEN\nThe position of knowledge and expertise is changing radically, particularly in relation to how design literacy is affected when confronted with digital tools and media. Dick Rijken analyses design literacy on three levels – strategic, tactical, and operational – and examines the requirements of open design for developing a design vision, design choices and design skills.\nDick Rijken\nLife in this network society TREND: NETWORK SOCIETY is complex. We are involved in many different kinds of fluid relationships with friends, family, acquaintances, co-workers, project partners, companies, brands, websites, platforms, clubs, schools, and many other kinds of communities. More often than not, we maintain these relationships using digital media like Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, and plain old email. We connect, communicate and share like our lives depend on it – as, increasingly, they in fact do. SHARING\nIn his article, Paul Atkinson talks about the demise of thegrand narrative of modernist design. While this is very true, it is not solely applicable to design; it applies similarly to all grand narratives, and to modernism in general. Where we were once infatuated by concepts like universal truth and linear progress, we now find ourselves in a chaotic maze of anecdotes and interconnected ideas. Linear progress has become perpetual change with no shared direction. Within that change, we are on a perpetual quest for personal meaning, no longer seeking truth. All this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make life difficult and unpredictable. If we can learn to improvise and to adapt, life can be deeply meaningful and rewarding. We are not there yet, though; there is still a lot to learn.\n\nWE CONNECT, COMMUNICATE AND SHARE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. AS, INCREASINGLY, THEY IN FACT DO.\n\nThis article deals with the changing position of knowledge KNOWLEDGE and expertise in open networks. Digital tools and media are generic infrastructures for creating, sharing and transforming information. They enable and facilitate personal learning on a massive scale. Anything that can be converted into a digital format can also be stored, shared and used by anyone, anywhere. This changes everything that has anything to do with ideas – and therefore also changes design. It changes how we design, it changes what we design, it changes how we think about design, and it changes how we learn and teach design. Ultimately, it will also change who designs. Web 2.0, with the concept of user-generated content at its core, will not leave the design discipline untouched.\nFundamental Paradoxes\nIn order to understand what is happening to design, we need to understand two strongly related paradoxes that are fundamental features of networks: the paradox of identity, and the paradox of choice.\nThe paradox of identity arises from the fact that networks are made of nodes and links, i.e. identities and relationships. Nodes have their own unique identity, but that identity is meaningless without links to other nodes. We have become more independent from others through the development and actualization of our own unique individual self. But at the same time, we have become more dependent on others, since who we are depends to a large extent on who we relate to and interact with. We feel a need to stand out in a crowd, but we are nothing if not connected. TREND: NETWORK SOCIETY\nWe depend on fluid networks around us for our daily lives’ activities. Parties are announced on and communicated through Facebook, and the fun is later shared SHARING through pictures on Flickr. We find jobs using LinkedIn, where we present our professional résumés, and ask people we’ve worked with in the past to write positive testimonials about us. We don’t exist if we have no visible presence in the networks we want to be involved in. If you are what you act like, you better make sure you act like who you are – or who you want to be.\nThis makes the network society an essentially cultural place. This is true not just in the anthropological sense that everything we learn is seen as ‘culture’, but in a very instrumental sense as well: activities like ‘expression’ and ‘reflection’ that are at the core of art and related cultural activities give form to the networked life of an individual. And this brings us to the second paradox, the paradox of choice. We are the designers of our own lives through the choices we make, and there are more choices open to us now than ever before. At the same time, this freedom has a dark side to it: we_must_choose, whether we like it or not. MASS CUSTOMIZATION The freedom of choice that we have is also an inescapable obligation. With choice comes responsibility. The ability to reflect and give form to our lives within given constraints is just as important for an individual as reading, writing or arithmetic. In this context, we move from ‘design as culture’ to a culture of design, where design is part of our natural mode of being.\nAtoms and Bits\nThere is help at our disposal. Digital tools, digital media and the vast resources on the internet collectively create a massive open and accessible infrastructure for individual and communal expression and reflection. In some domains, we have seen an explosive amount of activity (music production, digital photography) that has turned whole industries upside down. OPEN EVERYTHING Other domains are just getting warmed up. This is particularly true for three-dimensional objects. As different technologies for 3D printing are becoming affordable, Fab Labs (‘fabrication laboratories’, a concept developed at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms) have spread from inner-city Boston to rural India, from South Africa to the far north of Norway. Activities in Fab Labs range widely, including technological empowerment; peer-to-peer, project-based technical training; local problem-solving; small-scale, high-tech business incubation; and grassroots research.\n\nTHERE IS A PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MAKING THAT WORKS WITH STANDARDIZED FORMATS FOR SPECIFYING 3D DESIGNS, SO THAT OUR IDEAS FOR OBJECTS CAN BE PUBLISHED, SHARED AND MODIFIED JUST AS EASILY AS VIDEO CLIPS ON YOUTUBE.\n\nThere is a production infrastructure in the making that works with standardized STANDARDS formats for specifying 3D designs, so that our ideas for objects can be published, shared and modified just as easily as video clips on YouTube. Do-It-Yourself is no longer a matter of wood and nails; DIY DIY is becoming more refined in terms of possible forms and construction concepts. In other fields, technological impulses like this have created an explosion of creativity among experts and amateurs alike. Accompanying that surge of creative expression, there is an awareness of the fact that technological facilitation is only meaningful at a very basic level. Anything that is fundamentally expressive or reflective derives its value from ideas and values that are embodied – and ideas and values come from people, not from technology. Again: anything is possible, but what do we want? Before we can rearrange atoms, we have to rearrange bits. Ideas! A richer palette of possible material forms requires a richer imagination than ever before. Buying a guitar does not make me a musician. Access to 3D design tools does not make me a designer.\nWhy Keep It Simple?\nThe concept of self-organization is an intriguing idea. Online media environments like YouTube, Flickr and Blogspot prove that well-designed (!) infrastructuresARCHITECTURE can indeed facilitate personal expression on a mind-boggling scale, but they have one thing in common: simplicity. The media formats are simple (‘upload a picture here’, ‘this is a heading, type your text here’), and the media produced and shared by these tools are simple (a picture, a movie clip, a piece of text). But real life is not always that simple. As I’ve argued above, in networks, life can be annoyingly complex and most of us are not born with sufficient imaginative capacity to fully utilize the potential of the production technologies that are currently available. Most of us need help. When it comes to more complex media or artefacts, rolling out infrastructures and expecting self-organization to take care of the rest is simply not enough. Organizing self-organization is a lot of work, and does in fact involve a great deal of design and inspiration.\n\nWE ARE DESIGNERS OF OUR OWN LIVES THROUGH THE CHOICES WE MAKE. THIS FREEDOM HAS A DARK SIDE TO IT: WE MUST CHOOSE, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.\n\nTraditional DIY stores know this very well. They don’t just sell basic construction materials anymore, but increasingly also offer ready-made lifestyle products: lamps, furniture, various semi-manufactured products, and so on. What’s more, they know that they need to help amateurs when it comes to making choices. Most websites for DIY stores DIY feature some form of assistance. Besides tips and suggestions from famous designers, there are online tools that help buyers figure out their personal preferences for interior design. I’ve even seen moodboard tools for interior decoration. For people who feel completely adrift in the sea of choices, there are style coaches to help buyers find out who they are and what choices to make.\nDesign Literacy\nWhen it comes to more innovative or complex designs, inspiration and imagination are just as crucial as production technologies. This holds true for seasoned pros and enthusiastic amateurs. When motivated prosumers want to express their identities, they need different kinds of knowledge and skills, which together make up what we can call ‘design literacy’. I suggest we conceptualize this at the following three levels:\nStrategic visionKnow what you want, based on knowing who you are and what you want to achieve. This is about an awareness of personal goals and values. It can be very explicit, translated into formulated criteria, or very implicit, in which case there is an intuition that can be used to judge examples and design choices. Both approaches can work; more often than not, they co-exist in some form. Whatever it is that you’re going to make, you have to feel its soul and formulate its mission. There is probably no better example here than Steve Jobs, who has always had a very specific vision about using computing technology for personal goals, as opposed to serving the needs of businesses or governments. Apple was founded in 1979; over 30 years later, his vision has become a reality. Every product Apple has produced under Jobs’ guidance was a conscious materialization of that vision. On a more intimate level, amateurs who want to redecorate their homes will be stifled rather than liberated by all the choices and possibilities if they do not have some kind of understanding of what kind of ‘vibe’ or ‘atmosphere’ they want in their house. They, too, need a vision. There is no other way.\nTactical choicesBe able to make choices that determine what it is that you are making. What you are making is ultimately a design that can be produced, in order to make the vision a reality. We are caught between heaven and earth here, and this is the true level where design takes place: crucial decisions are made on a conceptual level that will eventually determine the details of the end result. Choices about content, structure, behaviour and form are made and fixed. This is where professional design becomes a profession, and craftsmanship begins to play a role. The question is: how much professional expertise is needed? Can this be done by an amateur? AMATEURISSIMO It’s hard to have to start from scratch. Tweaking something that’s already close may be a better way to go. Open design to the rescue! If you see something you like, just download it and modify it to represent your vision. We’ll return to that later.\nOperational skillsBe able to use available production tools and infrastructures. This can range from knowing how to point and shoot with a digital camera or upload a video to YouTube to making a final mix of a song that sounds good on different speaker systems or specifying a design with 3D modelling software for a 3D printer.\nThese are the pillars of what we can call ‘design literacy’: the development of vision (strategic), the formulation of a design (tactical), and technical production (operational). There are interesting interactions between the three levels, however. Ultimately, available production tools and infrastructure determine what can be made in the first place, so operational skills and tactical choices are often strongly aligned. There are also crucial links between tactical choices and strategic vision. If a 3D modelling tool is very user-friendly, very responsive, and well connected to the production tools (possibly through data standards), then the boundary between a sketch and a final design starts to blur, and users can work in a state of flow, where all three levels are active simultaneously.\n\nONLINE ENVIRONMENTS PROVE THAT WELL DESIGNED INFRASTRUCTURES CAN FACILITATE PERSONAL EXPRESSION ON A MIND-BOGGLING SCALE, BUT THEY HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON: SIMPLICITY.\n\nThe distinctions between the three kinds of literacy are epistemological: they involve different kinds of expertise. All three involve mentality, knowledge, and skills – three very familiar pedagogical concepts. Thus, design literacy can be learned, just like many other things, but there’s more to it than learning to work the tools.\nBecoming Literate\nProfessional designers DESIGNERS have all the necessary expertise. They have an important role to play in the large-scale development of design literacy. They can be heroes when their high-quality designs inspire eager amateurs. They can produce examples to be shared on online platforms that can be used, modified and re-distributed. They can explain how they work, e.g. as teachers in face-to-face courses and online videos. In working towards the advancement of design literacy, professionalism is still our starting point.Going back to the three central concepts of design literacy mentioned above (vision, design, and production), there are interesting opportunities and challenges in the organization of design literacy:\nStrategic visionThe development of a personal vision can be facilitated by presenting, explaining and discussing high-quality designs from professional designers. The development of vision can be a vulnerable and intuitive process, and seeing how pros do it (in a video interview, for instance) can be very helpful and inspiring. Formulating the right question is often the best way to try and find a solution. Inspiration is the keyword here: designers can be inspiring through what they make, but also through showing how they came up with the right vision to begin with.\nTactical choicesThe formulation of a design can be facilitated by the same high-quality examples, when they are published in ways that allow for inspection, modification and sharing. Open design plays a crucial role in this. Online environments that feature collections of high-quality examples that can be analysed, used, modified, discussed and re-published hold immense potential. Users need to be able to inspect the internal structure of a design, and then modify and share it. Designers can produce these examples and share their methods and insights in interviews or debates, and design teachers can develop new pedagogical methods and formats. In the world of digital media, users make mashups, REMIX devising new combinations of chunks of information found elsewhere to create coherent new constructs. Open design allows for a similar approach to 3D objects, physical equivalents to mashups that can also be shared and discussed with others.\nOperational skillsTechnical production is the easiest skill, since all it requires is decent interface design for the relevant tools, supported by access to technical knowledge in the form of instruction manuals in print, video, or other formats. Many people can teach themselves how to do this and help each other using social media, such as forums or blogs.\nNot everything can be done exclusively in the digital domain. There is definitely a need for face-to-face encounters with ‘designer heroes’, design teachers and fellow design amateurs. There is a potential here for existing cultural institutions like public libraries, archives and museums to organize the exchange of knowledge KNOWLEDGE between pros and amateurs, as well as but just as much between amateurs and other amateurs. They can become hotspots in the real world where amateurs go to work on their expertise. STEIM is an example of such a hotspot.\nDesign into the Future\nThe STEIM story below illustrates a shift in the focus of skilled professionals: from high-quality production to high-quality coaching and education in order to facilitate expression and reflection in a larger community of passionate amateurs. Such a significant shift does not happen out of the blue; it is a deliberate choice and it takes real work, based on an informed awareness of how our world is changing. REVOLUTION This new mentality is the ideal complement to the exchange of information and ideas that is made possible through open design and new technological infrastructures. This calls for an ecosystem of people, institutions, relationships, tools and open infrastructures, where design becomes a natural activity for all those involved. Deliberate initiatives to foster design literacy need to address the three levels discussed above. Open design is essentially a highly social affair: amateur users will gather in online environments that help them by offering good examples in the form of available open designs, which are accompanied by interviews with heroes that explain how they navigate through all three levels of literacy. Heroes are attractors; people will flock around them, learn from them and from each other. Some parts of this ecosystem will grow and flourish autonomously, but others will need to be very consciously designed and planned in order to create a vibrant and living environment. It will help us find inspired ways to deal with tough issues like identity and choice in complex and unpredictable networks.\n\nTHE STEIM STORY\nSTEIM is a laboratory in Amsterdam that experiments with electronic musical instruments for live performance. This was a very specialized affair in the 80s and in the 90s. STEIM’s instrument designers would develop personal instruments and user interfaces for musicians. They became world-famous for their expertise in connecting musical goals (strategic) to technical solutions (operational) through skilful design (tactical).\nDuring the 90s, however, sensor technology and software became more widely available and more affordable. At the same time, the internet became a widely used platform for sharing knowledge and solutions among musicians. STEIM’s core activity became a DIY craze. STEIM consistently supported this trend, being one of the first organizations to hack cheap Wii controllers for musical applications and publishing electronic diagrams for its best-known musical instrument, the crackle box. But as this was happening, STEIM and its professionals had to reorient themselves to the changing situation.\nNowadays, STEIM is an important node in a world-wide knowledge network. There are more workshops than ever before. Moreover, starting in 2011, STEIM will offer a master’s degree in ‘Instruments and Interfaces’ in collaboration with the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. It has become a vibrant hub for learning about DIY instrument design and meeting other people with similar interests. There is a strong co-creation culture. Musicians are challenged to develop their personal ideas about the kind of music they want to make (strategic vision), and STEIM helps them develop their ideas, through co-design (tactical choices) and co-production by means of software configuration and the building of physical objects (operational skills).\nMany people who visit STEIM don’t just leave with an instrument; in their time there, they have learned how an instrument is made. And the instrument is just the beginning; there needs to be substantial time spent in learning to play it, as well as resisting the temptation to tweak it further. This represents a big risk at the tactical choice level: know when to stop modifying and start using a product! This is expertise that transcends the operational level. This is years and years of experience feeding into how musicians are currently coached and educated.\nwww.steim.org\n"},"topics/teaching-attitudes-approaches-structures-and-skills.html":{"url":"topics/teaching-attitudes-approaches-structures-and-skills.html","title":"Teaching Attitudes, Approaches, Structures and Skills","keywords":"","body":"Written by Caroline Hummels and published in Open Design Now!\n\nTEACHING ATTITUDES, SKILLS, APPROACHES, STRUCTURE AND TOOLS / CAROLINE HUMMELS\nTaking a critical look at current educational models, open design will involve a shift in the relationship between designers and potential users in terms of attitude, skills and approach. Caroline Hummels discusses the consequences of open design for the educational approach and for the structure and tools offered. She advocates an educational model that reflects the flexibility, openness, and continuous development of open design.\nCaroline Hummels\nDoes training for open design require a different style of education? Current initiatives like Linux, VOICED and Fab Lab show the beauty of open platforms for sharing and learning, without requiring its contributors to follow specialized AMATEURISSIMO education. Despite this innate advantage, an educational model that is slanted specifically towards open design is needed. This chapter discusses how we can shape that model in such a way that it enables designers to blossom in an open structure. Although I focus on design education, the model can also be applied to other fields of expertise.\nThe Aim and Focus of Open Design\nSo why do we need a specific education style to facilitate open design? In fact, we don’t. I do, however, believe that education should reflect upon its own paradigms, and envision what types of designers society will need in the future. Open design is one of the reasons to look critically at current educational models. Society is always changing. REVOLUTION What that means right now, for example, is that we have to be able to deal creatively and flexibly with large amounts of constantly evolving information. It also means that we currently have to find answers to large societal questions, now that we have reached the limits of our financial and environmental ecologies, among other frameworks. Open design addresses and works with these overall trends. TRENDS\nOpen design assumes open access, sharing, change, learning and ever-evolving knowledge and skills. It is an open and flexible platform instead of a closed one. Consequently, open design emerges from the New Science paradigm of quantum physics, relativity and self-organizing structures, developed by such scientists as Einstein, Bohr and Prigogine.1Where Newton’s classical-scientific view is essentially simple and closed – it can be modelled through time-reversible laws and all complexities can be reduced to simplicities – Prigogine’s reality is multiple, temporal and complex. It is open and admissible to change.\nDesign education based on a New Science paradigm requires a transformative curriculum, according to Doll2. In such a transformative curriculum, teachers discard the God’s-eye view, uniform curricula and tests that are considered objective and predictive. On the contrary, they emphasize and support a variety of positions, procedures and interpretations. Design education for open design could benefit from theories like Constructivism, where learning is the learner’s active construction of meaning in context.\n\nOPEN DESIGN IS BASED ON A LIBERTARIAN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DESIGNERS AND POTENTIAL USERS, AND NOT ON A RATIONAL ONE IN WHICH THE DESIGNER IS SEEN AS SUPERIOR.\n\nIt is possible to postulate what educating for open design could look like, based on a constructivist learning model. The educational model for open design described below addresses attitudes and skills, approaches, and structure and tools. The figures in the text exemplify these topics by showcasing the educational model we use in the Department of Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology.\nLearning the Attitudes and Skills for Open Design\nIn his bookThe Craftsman,3Richard Sennett describes the importance of a craftsman’s intrinsic motivation, commitment to doing good work for its own sake, and an ongoing pursuit of mastery in his or her craft. This attitude is the basis for the success of open communities like Linux, where the reward system is based on the quality of the outcome, social appraisal within the group (peer review) and the personal development of the contributors. The success of open communities like Linux depends on a set of attitudes, skills and activities that foster learning from experience, developing skills through doing, curiosity, ambiguity, imagination, opening up, questioning, collaborating, open-ended conversation, experimentation, and intimacy. It is these attitudes, skills and activities that will also determine the success of open design.\nI therefore consider it essential that design education focus on forming self-directed and life-long learners, who are intrinsically motivated and who take responsibility for developing their own competencies and delivering high-quality work. Design students should learn to trust their senses and their intuition, and to embrace ambiguity, open-endedness and experimentation, as explained in the next section on approaches to open design. Moreover, design students should develop the attitude geared towards collaboration, CO-CREATION preferably supported by methods, tools and structures that foster collaboration (as explained in the last section on structure and tools for open design). It is not only designers who are participating in open design; in principle, everyone can participate. The key aspect is that everyone contributes their own expertise, while respecting and building on the expertise of others. This is especially true when addressing larger societal questions and designing systems where expertise is needed from a range of fields, including design, social sciences and engineering. KNOWLEDGE\nBlurring Boundaries\nOpen design implies that the boundary between designers and users is blurring, at least with respect to motivation, initiative and needs. So what does this mean for the interaction between designers and potential users? On the basis of my organizational classification,4open design is based on a libertarian relationship between designers and potential users, and not on a rational one in which the designer is seen as superior. Neither is it based on an integrating relationship, in which the designer looks after the interest of the majority of potential users. The libertarian approach emphasizes the freedom and personal responsibility of every individual. This means that the designer is no longer placed above users when determining what is right for them; rather, the designer is part of a larger community.5\nTo be clear, this does not imply that everyone now becomes a designer, as IKEA and many others are implying. WYS ≠ WYG The design profession is still something that requires many years of education and practice, like any other profession. It does mean, however, that potential users now add their own experience and specific competencies to the mix.Based on the aforementioned, I consider it essential for current design education to teach students to cooperate with other experts, respecting their expertise and simultaneously reflecting on their own competencies. This means, for example, that design students need to learn to work as part of multi-disciplinary teams, collaborating with students from other departments and schools, both on the same level and on different levels, e.g. students from a regional training centre, a university of applied sciences and a university of technology working together on projects. Moreover, design students need to learn to collaborate intensively with potential users, not as objective researchers that perform one or several user studies, not merely as facilitators that run co-design sessions, but also as subjective participants in an intensive process in which they themselves are part of the solution.\nThe Approach to Open Design\nDue to the flexibility, open-endedness and often innovative character of open design, students should have first-hand experience with the fact that design decisions are always conditional; such decisions are always based on insufficient information, are but taken to the best of their and the community’s experience and knowledge at that point. They can use two strategies to generate information to support these decisions, which reciprocally provide focus: design making (synthesizing and concretizing) and design thinking (analysing and abstracting).\nSince open design depends highly on different people and expertise, including the element provided by potential users, tangible solutions that can be experienced are essential throughout the design process to validate ideas and to guide further developments. STANDARDS Moreover, design-making opens up new solution spaces that go beyond imagination, especially in group settings and when focusing on innovative, disruptive products which lack a well-established frame of reference for users or the market. It recalls the adage ‘quality through quantity’.\nI consequently advocate that design students learn to use a highly iterative process of generating dozens of solutions and testing themin situ, in their proper context.  The Reflective Transformative Design Process6offers such a flexible and open process that it regards the act of designing not only as thought, but as a generator of knowledge. The process supports developing a vision of social and societal transformation, exploring solutions_in situ_with others, as well as offering moments of reflection.\n\nStructures and Tools for Open Design\nOpen design requires a place to co-operate. That said, a hybrid design environment would both take advantage of a digital space that is always available all over the world, while making use of the intensity of collaborating in a physical workspace, making things, exchanging ideas and knowledge, and testing designs in context with potential users. A beautiful example of such a hybrid community is Beppe Grillo’s blog,7which enables people to share digitally COMMUNITY and to meet each other all over the world. What does this mean for design education? Faculties, departments and schools have to think both physically and virtually about workspaces that enhance collaboration. CO-CREATION At the Department of Industrial Design here at Eindhoven University of Technology, we have structured our workspaces thematically to provide areas in which students can work together, share expertise and learn from each other. In addition to a supportive structure, open design would benefit from tools that support designing and sharing, for a variety of contributors. Design education can support students in exploring these tools through methods such as participatory design, co-design or rapid prototyping equipment at Fab Labs. Universities and schools can also develop open design tools and methods, such as Skin 2.0,8the Fab@home printers or design tools developed by former ID students at Studio Ludens.\nConclusions\nOpen design not only forces designers to think about their profession, role, attitude and competencies, but also challenges design educators to scrutinize their educational system. In this article I have discussed what open design means for the designer’s attitude, skills and approach as well as for the educational structure and tools offered. Since we have stressed the flexibility, open-endedness and often innovative character of open design, the educational model for open design will also be flexible and open, and will need continuous development and testing with all parties involved to become a truly open design system.\n\nDoll, W, ‘Prigogine: A New Sense of Order, A New Curriculum’ in Theory into Practice, Beyond the Measured Curriculum 25(1), 1986, p. 10-16. ↩\nIdem. ↩\nSennett, R, The Craftsman.

In a world less controlled by branding and regulations, a new breed of designers can contribute to an altered, more honest economy. An interview with Dutch designer Joris Laarman, contemplating his relationship to modernism and the modernist roots of open source design and digital fabrication.\nGabrielle Kennedy\nThere’s always something special about the top crop of Dutch design graduates, but every once in a while one comes along that makes everyone sit up and take notice. In 2003, that was Joris Laarman. His Reinventing Functionality project at the Design Academy of Eindhoven fused function with ornament and was snatched up by Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.\n\nDESIGN MUST ACCEPT SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CREATING MANY OF THE WORLD’S CURRENT PROBLEMS.\n\nSince then, he has earned a reputation for himself as a designer with visionary ideas and a concern for societal issues. His first project out of school, the Bone Furniture range, was exhibited in the Friedman Benda gallery in New York, a limited edition series made from marble, porcelain and resin. While he calls it an “annoying coincidence” that much of his work has spawned major contemporary trends, it also testifies to its relevance to the issues that matter.\nFurniture That Can Be Grown\nBoth those early projects clearly expressed Laarman’s highly specific views on modernism. The_Bone_range DESIGNERS resulted from a cooperative partnership with car manufacturer Opel, using software to design a series of artworks based on the organic way that bones form. Car parts are designed with the help of topology optimization software to increase strength and maximize the efficient use of materials. Furniture, as it turns out, can also be ‘grown’ by adding and removing material to maximize its strength and functionality.\nLaarman’s stance is that functionality and extravagance are not mutually exclusive. Where modernism went wrong, and how its core advantages need to be readdressed, are what drive his research. What he is looking for are design solutions that possess a revolutionary quality. Much of his current research repudiates how things are currently done and patiently pursues a better way not just to manufacture, but also to distribute design.\nSeen in this light, design must accept some of the responsibility for creating many of the world’s current problems. More importantly, it can play a key role in fixing them. In 2009, Laarman opened his Amsterdam studio to the public for the first time. His purpose was to share his thinking and his process. He wanted to reveal how design experimentation and research can create answers, not just pretty objects.\n“In galleries and in Milan, people only ever see perfect pieces,” he says. “In this exhibition, I wanted people to see the research part of design, what is behind all the pretty shapes, and how they could eventually be of use in the world. I wanted people to understand what the future of design could look like using technological progress.”\nLaarman hit a wall when he was researching open source design and digital fabrication. He realized that design had taken a wrong turn somewhere along the way and was now failing society. “I am not necessarily against how design is now,” he says, “but I do think the internet can provide a more honest way to design, make, distribute and sell things.” Not modernism, then; what’s needed is a new -ism. It takes some audacity for such a young designer to criticize the industry. Laarman has gone beyond theoretical criticism, underlining his opinion with some tangible ideas that he wants to try out – hopefully with the support of his contemporaries.\n\nI DO THINK THE INTERNET CAN PROVIDE A MORE HONEST WAY TO DESIGN, MAKE, DISTRIBUTE AND SELL THINGS.\n\n“I started to think of my work and of design in general as a sort of laboratory,” Laarman says. He explains it as a place where solutions might be found to the predicament created by over-production in the post-industrial age. “I’m not condemning the whole design industry,” he says, “or even questioning it. There is a lot of very good industrial production, and that will never go away, but I think it will soon be joined by another revolution made possible by the internet.” REVOLUTION\nDespite its failures and the role it played in creating over-production, Laarman’s research kept bringing him back to modernism – not as an aesthetic per se, but as a philosophy. In 2010 Laarman was selected by Ingeborg de Roode, curator of industrial design at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, to participate in the Modernism Today series. “I guess she sees me as a sort of contemporary version of Rietveld,” DESIGNERS says Laarman. “That is an interesting comparison, and I see some connection.” 100 years ago, Gerrit Rietveld experimented with technology and materials; Laarman does the same today. His aesthetic is not in the tradition of De Stijl, but his values most certainly are.\nThe Modernist Roots (of Open Design)\nIn line with those values, it made good sense to fuse Rietveld’s world of ideas and experiments with open source design and digital fabrication; both could be argued to have modernist roots. Open source has been revolutionizing the cultural content universes of music and software for almost a decade, so why shouldn’t it also be able to change the way design is both made and distributed?\n“I think true modernists wanted open source design one hundred years ago,” says Laarman, “but back then it wasn’t possible. Rietveld published manuals about how to make his chairs, but nobody could really use that information, because there were no networks of skilled artisans. His designs look simple, but are difficult to construct. These days, we can distribute knowledge in a way that can potentially bring craftspeople back to the centre stage of design – not in an idealistic, naïvely romantic way, but in an economically sound way. All we need are the networks, and cheaper and more accessible digital manufacturing technology.” One of modernism’s core flaws was the huge amount of power that ended up in the hands of a few big factories and design firms. The movement was supposed to be about the democratization of design – that was their big idea – but somewhere along the line it became nothing more than an aesthetic. Of course there are some obvious differences between modernism and open source design. Modernism produced an international and generic style. Industrialization led to mass production, which meant production had to be centralized and its products transported across the globe from countries with the lowest wages at great environmental and economic expense. Information and knowledge were kept closed and protected by copyrights; even if they had been accessible, it would have been impossible for an individual to use the design data without access to exorbitantly expensive production tools. The quality of design produced was and continues to be guaranteed by the producer; in turn, the producer and the retailer divide the majority of sales revenues.\n\nI THINK TRUE MODERNISTS WANTED OPEN SOURCE DESIGN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\n\nOpen source design, on the other hand, has the capacity to conserve culture and decoration as well as traditional skills by utilizing new technology.Digital production makes mass customization possible. Open source makes information and knowledge public; in addition, it has low entry costs, quality control takes place in the form of peer review by the public, and revenues are divided between craft and creativity. Also, because the products of open source design can be produced locally, transportation costs are drastically reduced.\nWhat open source design does is redistribute knowledge KNOWLEDGE and the means of production. It has the potential to change everything that we know about design, from manufacturing to education. Open source design is anti-elitist insofar as it can create fairer and more honest prices. It is democratic and helps to create self-determination in an individual’s immediate environment. Ultimately, it takes power away from the huge multinationals and from production hubs like China and India and hands it back to craftspeople – those individuals rendered irrelevant by industrialization. In short, open source design could feasibly become this century’s new-ism.\n\nULTIMATELY, IT TAKES POWER AWAY FROM THE MULTINATIONALS AND PRODUCTION HUBS LIKE CHINA AND HANDS IT BACK TO CRAFTSPEOPLE – THOSE INDIVIDUALS RENDERED IRRELEVANT BY INDUSTRIALIZATION.\n\n“This does not mean that anyone can make good design or that more rubbish can be produced,” Laarman says. “Just because everyone has a digital camera doesn’t mean that everyone is a photographer. I am not in favour of amateurism, but the way I envision the system working, the good will eventually be filtered from the bad.” AMATEURISSIMO\n\nLess Production Is Needed, Not More.\nStatistics show that up until the Industrial Revolution, a similar amount of products were being produced every year. With industrialization came increased wealth and prosperity, which lead to massive increases in production. The result was more waste, more environmental damage TREND: SCARCITY OF RESOURCES and a surge in unemployed artisans. The average Western person today has access to more things than Queen Victoria owned during her reign. “The tragedy is that the vast majority of what is being today made lacks creativity and quality and isn’t really needed,” Laarman says. “The over-production of mediocrity for the middle classes has created a difficult economic situation, and there is nothing that can be done about it within the current system.”\nIf digital design went local, imagine what this would mean for small producers. “Right now, most people are just talking about digital fabrication,” says Laarman, “but it is happening, and I think can eventually take over. I am not going to say it will change the world, but it will change the way things are made. 3D printing is still very limited, AESTHETICS: 3Despecially in terms of materials, but as digital manufacturing technology evolves, anything is possible.”\nOne possible scenario would be for local communities to invest in technology. “There are already all kinds of initiatives popping up that give individuals the opportunity to start their own small production facilities,” Laarman says. “We are looking into setting up a sort of professional Fab Lab, for instance, where any design based on a digital blueprint could be mass-customized and made.”\nIt could work. The RepRap machine, for example, is an open-branded DIY 3D printing machine. HELLO WORLD The RepRap is a machine that you can make yourself (and that can reproduce itself!) REPRODUCTION that can in turn make other gadgets. “Right now, this sort of thing is the domain of geeks for geeks, but once it becomes more professional, it will be ready for more general usage,” Laarman says.\n\nTHE AVERAGE WESTERN PERSON TODAY HAS ACCESS TO MORE THINGS THAN QUEEN VICTORIA OWNED DURING HER REIGN.\n\nOpen source design and local digital fabrication could also revolutionize education, which has mostly become outdated and irrelevant. “We could tie the platform into trade schools,” Laarman says. “Education has fallen behind and kids are not being taught what is needed. Digital manufacturing should be taught in schools, especially at the vocational school level.”These developments are slow, however, because open source design remains the great unknown, with many unanswered quandaries. The new, innovative nature of the ideas works both for and against them; instead of inspiring images of a world less controlled by branding and regulations, open source design ends up sounding chaotic, with too much choice and an over-abundance of experimentation and waste. Issues of copyright and profit-sharing scare off many, leaving a lot of the earliest experimental platforms looking unprofessional and insecure. MANIFESTOS\nBut the problem for most of the current websites selling open source design is they lack professional participation. What’s needed is more of the best and most visionary design minds debating and devising ways to make it all work. “What is happening so far isn’t really making a difference, but it does show that there is huge potential,” Laarman says.\nCreative Commons CREATIVE COMMONS has made some interesting inroads. It is a new type of copyright that protects a designer (or anyone else) so that they can make licensing agreements with suitable producers or limit use of their ideas to personal use only. “It works in an idealistic sense if everybody plays nice,” says Laarman. It is still limited, though, and resembles a small-scale iTunes dominated by amateur musicians playing a limited number of instruments. What is needed next is a professional digital platform, or a network where people can meet, access and share information about how and where to have design digitally manufactured.\n\nDIGITAL MANU­FACTURING SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY AT THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL LEVEL.\n\nMake-Me .com\nOne exciting project already under way, albeit in its nascent stages, is Make-Me.com, a cooperative venture involving Laarman, the Waag Society, Droog Design and some early internet pioneers. For designers, it means uploading their design for general distribution. For consumers, it means being able to access and customize design. For local producers, it means using licensing agreements to make the things that people want. “It reduces our carbon footprints and allows for more customization,” says Laarman.\n\nTHAT IS WHAT WE DO. WE TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE PAST AND SHAPE IT INTO SOMETHING NEW.\n\nMake-Me.com plans to operate like an app store. You go there to get what you want. Some of it is free and some of it is paid for; some are designed by amateurs and some by professionals. “The amateurs and the professionals have to compete against one another,” Laarman says. “You find the chair you want online via us and you go to the local Fab Lab to have it produced on the spot. The platform is linking consumers to craftspeople and digital fabrication tools.”\nMake-Me.com as an open source platform is not limited to design. “It is for journalists, architects, businesspeople, scientists – even a place you could go to for a new haircut,” says Laarman. Big pharmaceutical companies, for example, don’t want to invest in research on diseases that only affect small numbers of people, because there is no money to be made. An open source platform could open up possibilities for DIY bio-labs where scientists and doctors could access research and make their own medicines. “Anyone can use Make-Me.com to distribute information in a new way.”\nDesigners, however, fear what all this means for them in terms of copyright. They think production companies protect their intellectual property, the quality of their designs, and guarantee them an income. What that fails to recognize is that copyright is a complicated question. Who really owns an original idea? Is anything truly and completely original? Every creative person pilfers and borrows ideas from everywhere; referencing what came before is a natural part of the creative process. “That is what we do,” says Laarman. “We take something from the past and shape it into something new.” REMIX Via Creative Commons licensing, it might become possible to profit from someone stealing your idea.\nWhat limits the scope of open source at this point goes beyond legal concerns. For it to work, a whole new economic model would need to be devised and accepted. Under the current system, a designer takes his or her design to a manufacturer, who makes it and then takes it to a shop that sells it. “If he is lucky, the designer gets 3% ex factory,” Laarman says. “The brand adds 300% and the shop doubles that again. It’s ridiculous how little of the cut a designer gets. If we used digital tools and changed the way stores work, the ratio would be able to favour creativity and the craftsman.”\nHowever, test-driving a new model will require a platform like Make-Me.com. It has to be large scale, and it will need to attract big-name designers and brands so that people can see it working. It’s a tough chicken-and-egg situation: unless designers feel that their financial income and copyright dues are guaranteed, they are not going to take the risk – and without enough designers taking the risk, it will be virtually impossible to erect the solid infrastructure to ensure smooth, safe and legal operations. It will take a coordinated leap of faith from educational facilities, designers and craftspeople for anything like this to work.None of these obstacles are insurmountable. What Laarman wants is to be a part of the experiment and to be a contributing member of that generation who will be defining the parameters and creating the way forward. It is that vision which distinguishes him from a lot of his contemporaries – he has the commitment and the patience. He knows that this is something big and wants to do whatever it takes to make it work. “Right now, I am making very expensive, limited-edition designs,” he says. “That is a good way to fund the experiments and start a business, but eventually what I’d like to be able to do is provide open source versions of my work for everyone. That is my goal.”\nHe knows he doesn’t have all the answers, but Laarman is working through all these problems one by one. “I don’t want to say that this idea could take over the entire production world,” he says, “but it can certainly help craftspeople to make things that are not standardized or mass produced. If a world-wide network of craftspeople grows, then this could potentially really change things.”\nClosed Societies Fail\nWhichever way you look at this, design cannot continue as is. Design reveals a lot about society, and closed societies fail; like organisms that shut themselves off from their environment, a society that shuns reality will eventually die. Likewise, closed design is outdated. Open source, whether it can be what designers want or even understand at this point, is one way for design to play a real role in building a new, more honest economy. A world with less mass production, less waste, less transportation and less standardized design STANDARDS can only be interpreted as a win-win situation for all concerned.\nAnother decade of discussion is needed before open source design will ever be able to make a tangible difference. Interestingly, the same arguments being used against the phenomenon now are the very same arguments that were once used against the introduction of democracy. The ruling elite will always feel threatened by the idea of giving power to the people.\n\nWHAT I’D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO IS PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE VERSIONS OF MY WORK FOR EVERYONE.\n\n"},"watching/open-structures-thomas-lommee.html":{"url":"watching/open-structures-thomas-lommee.html","title":"Open Structures: Thomas Lommee","keywords":"","body":"Open Structures: Thomas Lommee\nIn this lecture, Thomas Lommee discusses modular systems and their implications for design.\nYoutube: Open Structures: Thomas Lommee at TEDxEutropolis (12:10)\n"},"reading-reflections/chapter_11_jeffersons_gravestone_metaphorical_extensions_of_d.html":{"url":"reading-reflections/chapter_11_jeffersons_gravestone_metaphorical_extensions_of_d.html","title":"Chapter 11.

This is serious (though playful) product design. You can create your own custom parts from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, and others, or found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. A part is a discrete element and is different from an ingredient in that it maintains its structural integrity when it's separated, whereas an ingredient gets combined and can not be separated again without a complex separation process. Ingredients should not form the basis of the toy.\nThe primary goal of this project is to apply open design concepts to creating object using commonly available resources, and empower others to do the same. Secondary goals are to become familiar with product and market research, gain experience with user testing and feedback, practice presenting design process, produce knowledge design, and explore the IKEA effect for products. Read more about the IKEA effect.\nNote: Remember, none of this is fiction. You are creating a real instruction set with everything needed for the end user to do this on their own. If you are incorporating templates, include them in the instructions for your users.\nBackground\nAccording to the most recent and comprehensive data, 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.\nOriginally conceived by the Institute Without Boundaries, the Open Structures project has defined design guidelines to aid the users of the design framework: (1) Design for disassembly, (2) Design with recyclable materials, (3) Design from the OS grid. They are concerned that the objects can be taken apart once built, that they don't harm the environment if discarded, and that anything designed with the system will be interoperable. One project which also fits these guidelines is called OffBits, an open-source toy designed by a team in Tel Aviv that incorporates community challenges and up-cycled parts.\nInspiration\n\nNintendo Labo — Not entirely \"open,\" but an excellent example of IKEA affect in product design.\nMake — Blog of maker projects and tech crafts. \nInstructables— Amazing DIY tutorials\nhttps://hackaday.com/\nCraftster — Tutorials\nGetCrafty — Craft forum\nLifehacker — Some fun tutorials about hacking objects in unexpected ways. \nCubeecraft — Simple papercraft templates. \n\nPrevious student work\n\"Magnection\" by Daniel Bershefsky, 2017: Download (10MB)\nRequirements:\n\nParts should be simple (avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing).\nA kit should have more than one part (parts may be the same).\nMaterials should not cost more than $10.\nYou should be able to assemble three distinctly different objects with the same kit, tools, and assembly processes.\nEverything needed for another person to follow your instructions must be included in the PDF. This may include templates. Remember, this is an open source kit, not a boxed toy available in a store; everything a person needs should be in the instructions or commonly available. \nDo not include another person's copyrighted work in your project that is not appropriately licensed. Typically a Creative Commons License will be needed. The project must be mostly your work, and should not rely on the design work of others.\nNo weapons. We can define weapon as a device that uses projectiles powerful enough to cause harm to others. For example, a small-scale table-top device that shoots paper or foam projectiles as part of a game objective is fine. A handheld slingshot with the ability to propel objects at other people is a weapon.\n\nTips\nMake it original: There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you. \nA good way to create novelty with household objects is to substantially transform the shape through manipulating the materials. Rather than using a paper cup as is, transform it into a designed module. \nMake it fun: The kit should be joy to assemble and play with. Avoid tedious assembly and boring, pointless combinations of your modules. \nMake it variable: Remember the distinction between ingredients and modules (see top of page). Your modules should prioritize structure over decoration and offer many, many possible configurations. Imagine a \"library\" of parts that can be combined to create many results, the more pieces you have, the more possible configurations there are (though your pieces may all be identical).\n"},"projects/open_design/discover-toy-design-research.html":{"url":"projects/open_design/discover-toy-design-research.html","title":"Discover: Toy Design Research","keywords":"","body":"\nDiscover: Toy design research\nThis assignment will ask you to explore and explain some aspects the existing market for toys.

In biochemistry, metabolic pathways describe sequences of chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. In physiology, neural pathways describe chains of cells that carry signals connecting one part of the nervous system to another. And in the context of education, a learning pathway describes the sequence and range of knowledge a learner acquires over a duration of time. Your learning pathway, often referred to as a \"trajectory,\" is not always controllable, and can branch drastically in different directions as your values shift or constraints and opportunities emerge. With that said, to start down a pathway, it can be helpful to imagine the end-point of a learning pathway and work backwards to generate a strategy.\nIn this activity, you will respond to a series of questions aimed at helping you identify what you want to learn, and what you want to be really good at doing.
